    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Tilly and I broke up. Purpose of this blog is to keep &#x2F; flush out all my thoughts in one place.</p><p>End of November tilly and I had a conversation about continuing the relationsihps, after the converstaion it seems break up is the best choice for both of us moving forward.</p><p>Of course break up &#x3D; discrpency, there were four that tilly brought up in the conversation:</p><ul><li>sean tends to lay flat, and takes more time to improve on his current situation</li><li>sean is very rbotoics, unflexible towards expressing emotions</li><li>sean seem chaotic, less content &#x2F; express doubt about the relationship</li><li>sean has many female friends</li></ul><p>Now instead of refuting and proving myself, think from a third person perspective, how did these came into place?</p><p>Laying flat</p><ul><li>Tilly brought up two points, one was I am content with a job even with much inflexibility, the other was I tend to rest during off hours, instead of trying to make life better</li><li>Both were fine observations, what made her think that way I was more curious. I think it’s a culture issue.</li><li>Tilly and I came from two (very) different background. I was in US in 2013 so most influence came from parents. The older generation tends to be more passive, I remember hearing more on ‘不要太出头’, ‘让世界流经自己’, ‘要听老师的话’ etc etc.</li><li>Tilly’s influence came more so from her peers, which the younger generation is much more active. ‘只要付出就有回报’, ‘凡事事在人为’, ‘我命由我不由天’, etc.</li><li>And because of this mindset tilly always had a more settled life path, early November we chatted she was planning on a promotion in 2025, first house down payment in 2028, and work &#x2F; found a start up before 2030.</li><li>Tilly arguably has been great on this path, independent, reliable, hard working, all with her own effort. This has very little to do with age, more so on life choices. I must’ve been part of her life path and have deviated from the original plan, which caused the anexiety on her side.</li></ul><p>Robot like</p><ul><li>Saying ‘this is my first relationship’ felt more like an excuse at this point, my mind went back to last year when Elisa mentioned about the five types of love languages.</li><li>Now it would be naive to say the reason was love language diff. It’s been a year and I’ve already learned much. I felt it’s the delay in response of the love languages that made it difficult.</li><li>Tilly value very much in 生活中的新鲜的事物, especially experiencing these together. So things like going on trips together, photoshots, rock climbing all have been nice.</li><li>It tends to take me longer than usual to adapt, and when I adapted to the new type of language tilly has likely moved to something else, which, made my act more forced than I like to appear. One vivid memory was tilly mention wanting to have hotpots. By the time I executed the weather has cleared up, which hot pot was no longer the best choice.</li><li>Having to constantly propose new things and wait for me to follow must have been exhuasting, I resonate with the feeling.</li></ul><p>Chaotic universe</p><ul><li>Okay for context the full sentence I said was ‘这个宇宙充满混乱，当我们始终拥有选择’</li><li>That’s not the main point though, what made tilly thinking this was my thought of wanting to break up instead of the opposite.</li><li>I think it’s an communication issue, the way that I spoke made the difference.</li><li>Wenhao mentioned communication is about 距离, 权力, and 主动权. When the distance is close, power and energy around the same, whatever one says in the relationship would be beneficial.</li><li>It’s difficult for me to recall but I must’ve said it in a way that caused tilly to feel distanced. Perhaps I said it in a mono tune, perhaps I said it with avoidance, perhaps I said it that made her she is not the only choice.</li></ul><p>Female friends</p><ul><li>The observation was true, but again, the issue is about the judgement based on the observation, why did tilly felt that way</li><li>This is the hardest one of all, my best guess right now is about the difference of how we measure personal growth</li><li>Tilly tends to be quite mature, we were talking once of how Chip Nguyen measure personal growth and felt resonating towards tilly’s life path: rate of change, time to solve big problems, and number of future options.</li><li>TLDR for the article, they mentioned a fast personal growth is the one that changes oneself rapidly, solve big problems (career, family, finance) quickly, and have as many future options open possible.</li><li>I wonder if tilly measured my personal growth using the metric, and more importantly, if she thought my females friends was my act of keep my options open.</li><li>It’s the hardest for me to relate to this not because I don’t know, but I know it quite well. This feeling of betrayal she must have felt, thinking that she’ve poured everything into the relationship, where I appear to be playing around &#x2F; uncommital.</li></ul><p>So yeah, to wrap it up, relationship is about feelings, and feeling anxious, exhuasted, distant and betrayed in one is destrutive, which lead to the break up.</p><p>…</p><p>Be cautious here as I write like a victim, when an avalanche happen no snow flake is innocent, the relationship ended bc I was also the perpetrator, it matters much more that I learn from what happened, communicate better, and avoid the others at all cost.</p><p>…</p><p>One last note, I wish to write one emotional thought, just so the later self reading this grasp the feeling better.</p><p>I try to stay as objective but the past few days has been quite torturing, it peaked when I started writing this blog.</p><p>写这些最让我难受的不是分手本身，而是一种，深深的无力感？ 明明这些我在聊天中都已经看到&#x2F;听到了，可这些被说出口的时候又突然发现，似乎一切都已经太迟了。</p><p>可能经过一年的磨合我们才发现，爱和舍不得是两个东西吧。</p><p>…</p><p>I know both me and Tilly will find peace one day, I wish her all the best.</p>]]></content>

Chatted with tilly and she offered a different reasoning: Duolingo rn struggles to make money (duo max, english test, etc) -&gt; focus on monetizations -&gt; build a feature that lets the user pay more.</p><p>Tilly is always very progmatic towards problem solving, reminded of the first principle. For any PM takehomes this seems like the best way to apporach: asked to do a feature -&gt; what does the company wnat right now -&gt; what kind of metric are they tracking -&gt; what kind of feature can be built that boost the metric, very humbling to learn.</p><h3 id="Tutoring-Others"><a href="#Tutoring-Others" class="headerlink" title="Tutoring Others"></a>Tutoring Others</h3><p>About Tilly, the job coaching business is quite well, and she is thinking about expanding it further.</p><p>I always felt a bit against the business, entry level PM is extremely competitive given the easy entry (you have a 1% chance of getting in despite been above average), with no standards of been ‘good’ other than previous track records (again, makes it very easy to snowball late but hard to get in early), and most of the ‘correct’ way of getting a job has all been established online for free, not to mention Tilly’s experience rarely translates into her coaching.</p><p>杯水车薪 was what I was thinking, when experience&#x2F;practice takes up 80%+ of the success, what was taught in the session felt worthless, especailly given the price. And adding a layer more of irony the so called ‘career coaches’ I’ve seen are all junior PMs! How are they sharing advices when they themselves can’t figure out the role &#x2F; next step in their own life…</p><p>With all that been said I guess I felt concerned for Tilly, I am afraid she thinks the content she coaches is the key metric of success. I am scared bc this way she would evaluate her success directly with the offer her mentees gotten, makes her quite vunlerable as now the mentee’s effeort matters much more than hers (which she can’t control).</p><p>People reaches out to Tilly partly for her characters, but mostly for her fame. 6 PM internships + countless final round + founding a PM community + founding a start up + active and well networked with multiple senior PMs in the field, like literally, you can’t get that many buffs even when you are in a game.</p><p>With that much fame people who reaches out naturally have expectations on content and materials been taught, and to concrete my fear a bit further, I am afarid that Tilly would get stressed out not meeting the expectations on the outcome of her mentees.</p><p>So I was thinking in another way, the reason why there are so many junior PMs in the field of ‘career coaching’ is not because somehow they happened to know the field of PMs better, but the exact opposite - they understand the struggles the PM-wanna-bes are going through, and can offer emotional supports given their experience.</p><p>So, if Tilly ever felt down, I will try telling her this: these people reaches out to Tilly because they don’t believe they can be PMs. Tilly, instead of giving them the skillsets, gives them the courage of trying. So it doesn’t matter whether they learned or not, it’s about the mentee thinking that they learned, hence having the courage to try &amp; apply.</p><p>师傅领进门，修行在个人. I am really, really happy that Tilly is trying out a different side of jobs &amp; seems like she is enjoying it, I guess I am just too in love that I felt very attached to what she does &#x2F; how she feels, sigh :(</p><h3 id="Time-Spent-vs-Quality-Time"><a href="#Time-Spent-vs-Quality-Time" class="headerlink" title="Time Spent vs. Quality Time"></a>Time Spent vs. Quality Time</h3><img src="../images/oj-2024-10/floating-chopsticks.jpg" alt="Look floating chopsticks" style=""><span class="image-caption">Look floating chopsticks</span><p>A fun story that I saw:</p><blockquote><p>陶艺老师在开学第一天就宣布，他将把全班同学分成两组。他说，坐在工作室左侧的同学们，将根据他们的作品数量来评分，而坐在右侧的同学们，将根据作品的质量来评分。他的评分方法很简单：在课程的最后一天，他会带来他的浴室秤，对”数量”组的作品进行称重：50 磅的陶罐能得到”A”等级，40 磅的能得到”B”等级，以此类推。然而，对于被评价为”质量”的同学们，他们只需要制作出一个——尽管它必须是完美的——陶罐就可以得到”A”等级。<br>然而，到了评分的时候，一个有趣的事实浮现出来：最优质的作品都是由那些被评为”数量”的组别制作出来的。看起来，”数量”组在忙碌地大量制作作品的过程中——并从他们的错误中吸取教训——而”质量”组的同学们却在思考如何制作出完美的作品，结果他们的努力成果除了一些宏大的理论和一堆无用的黏土，别无他物。</p></blockquote><p>This week Tilly complians there was little quality time that we spent together, reminded me of this story.</p><p>Ever since I’ve started the new job most of my time where physcially contributed to San Jose. Which makes me wonder, 我之前在旧金山也没和 tilly 有啥 quality times 啊.</p><p>It’s the amount of time that matters, especailly in early relationships. Even arguments and simply be sitting together helps you learn someone better, which goes to the pot analogy, helps you to make the next pot better.</p><p>It’s an intersting shift of mindset, from ‘how can I spent better time with her’ to ‘how can I spent more time with her’, surprisingly the answers for both are very similar at this moment after a year of dating, I would take this as a good sign :).</p><h3 id="Bordem-in-Life"><a href="#Bordem-in-Life" class="headerlink" title="Bordem in Life"></a>Bordem in Life</h3><img src="../images/oj-2024-10/cotopaxi.jpg" alt="Halloween party on Hayes street Cotopaxi asked for a 魔法少女 & a llama hahah" style=""><span class="image-caption">Halloween party on Hayes street Cotopaxi asked for a 魔法少女 & a llama hahah</span><p>Continue on the life in San Jose, it has been, a bit quiet in my life.</p><p>Most of the workday is occupied with work, and ever since I blocked Instagram, WeChat, Zhihu and now RED, most of the world event takes around 2X to hit me lol.</p><p>Continue on the ‘one need 2-5 hours of free time’ narrative, it also matters the amount of focus you have, to quantify it, about three project is a good balance for me. A few I quickly get bored of the project, too much I ended up completing very little.</p><p>Currently I am exploring a new way of living, writing a story and helping a community, all three I happened to be intersted in, thus feeling satiated.</p>]]></content>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h3 id="Survior’s-Bias-in-Job-Hunt"><a href="#Survior’s-Bias-in-Job-Hunt" class="headerlink" title="Survior’s Bias in Job Hunt"></a>Survior’s Bias in Job Hunt</h3><img src="../images/oj-2024-09/drawing-contest.jpg" alt="Drawing contest between me and tilly, Tilly won by 11 points." style=""><span class="image-caption">Drawing contest between me and tilly, Tilly won by 11 points.</span><p>Crystal started job hunting, I had a similar experience back in May. Three weeks and 27 mock interviews, eventually I held it off in the end bc 1) everyone says diffrent things 2) the quality are a great mixed with people ranging from no to max expeirence</p><p>Thinking now this IS the text book definition of survivor’s bias. Around May the fitting PMs to the market have most likely gotten job offers, leaving only the average ones in the pool.</p><p>Which does match with the ‘apply early rule’, the benefits is three fold 1) you get faster in the queue when the recruiter sees fits 2) you move faster in the cycle given them more headcount &#x2F; less comparisons to look at and 3) there are more ‘good’ PMs who are around that you can mock with</p><p>I also think perhaps that’s the reason why relative comparisons (comparing to people who are in a similar spot as you) is a toxic trait, bc no matter if you are good or not, you are always comparing to below average candidates in the pool, which serves as a false reference.</p><p>But It’s difficult to get absolute matches, so the best choice here is to compare to oneself. And the best person I get to think of is Nancy, forging own path and try to find a different location on the map to go to.</p><p>Although People cool as Nancy also had a discovery period, I vividly remember Nancy also went through the relative compare phases, she wrote an whole article on securing the internship at Statefarm, did seem like she deelted though, that’s a shame I really liked that article :(</p><h3 id="Meeting-Stars"><a href="#Meeting-Stars" class="headerlink" title="Meeting Stars"></a>Meeting Stars</h3><img src="../images/oj-2024-09/frontier.jpg" alt="A conference on boat, was very fun" style=""><span class="image-caption">A conference on boat, was very fun</span><p>Back in 2022 I read an article about react videos, clipped the article and read it a few times. Early this month opened RED and 3 reaction video popped up, thought aobut the article again, read it through, found the author on LinkedIn, and sent a short message with thank you.</p><p>It turns out this person works at a founder commuinty and was very educaitonal &#x2F; intersting getting to learn her path in life, had a very fun conversation.</p><p>From time to time I get to remind myself life is non-linear, things pops up from time to time. Relationships, job hunts, investments, many many more. Goal here is less about complaining how anti-instinct these gets, more so writing here to remind myself that good things eventually come (so are bad things lol).</p><p>Let the world flow through you was what Weichen said in <a href="https://weichen.blog/cn/letters/65/">his blog</a>, still reading it through</p><h3 id="Documenting-Sharing"><a href="#Documenting-Sharing" class="headerlink" title="Documenting, Sharing"></a>Documenting, Sharing</h3><img src="../images/oj-2024-09/bear.png" alt="There was this activity at IKEA where you find 6 bears and get a prize, we found all 6 B)" style=""><span class="image-caption">There was this activity at IKEA where you find 6 bears and get a prize, we found all 6 B)</span><p>On the thought of letting the world flow through, much of my joy was found on documenting what I see &#x2F; learned while letting the world flow through.</p><p>The joy came from two parts, the obvious one of learning more about myself &#x2F; 当下自己所想的, and the other about sharing intersting things to others.</p><p>I found a X post this week mentioning this as a ‘pebbler’:</p><blockquote><p>So apparently the act of sending loved ones little videos and cute pictures and funny things throughout the day is called “Pebbling” because there’s a species of penguin that likes to leave pebbles in their partners’ nests to show they care, and this is my happy thing for today</p></blockquote><p>via Jonathan <a href="https://x.com/thisone0verhere/status/1828451988016607657">Edward Durham</a></p><p>Using the phrase pebbles, I am leaving peebles for others to show them I care, and leaving peebles for myself to help the future self to understand of current &#x2F; unstuck.</p><h3 id="Leaving-Gap-Between-Me-amp-Others"><a href="#Leaving-Gap-Between-Me-amp-Others" class="headerlink" title="Leaving Gap Between Me &amp; Others"></a>Leaving Gap Between Me &amp; Others</h3><p>This month I landed an offer, and held back on letting people around me know. Funny enough, through my years of living, this has happened a few times, where I create this buffer on situations that happens to me, to when they hear about the situations.</p><p>…</p><p>Last time I checked Intimate Relationships I was identified as avoidtantly attached, where I act indifferent towards people’s attention (yes, even when I would want them).</p><p>To me the reasons have always been 1) I put less trust on people around me 2) I want to prepare myself for the situations first and 3)I want to draw less attention.</p><p>All of these can be summarized towards ‘I hate people’ and wanting to be alone.</p><p>Now, right before I identified myself as an edge lord, Chloe provided a much clearer view on a similar issue. Chatting with her made me realize it’s not that I don’t like people (and so much the opposite), I very much like the people around me, it’s just really difficult for me to let them have expectations of me.</p><p>Of course I can’t control what people’s expectation of me can be lol, so I just held back of my life all together</p><p>…</p><p>I am afraid that people around me will be disappointed of me, so I held my life away from them, not letting them to have a close shot, trying to present this stable, slow pacing, upward view. Quoting what Chloe said, it’s a combnation of having too much expectations of myself &amp; fear of not meeting others’ expectation, all combined with a worry that no one understand what this feeling is.</p><p>It’s less about I don’t care, but perhaps I care too much, I want to people around me to look at the perfect me, and writing it now, it does feel quite aggrogant thinking in that way.</p><p>Which, I think that’s also a reason why I feel drawn towards tilly? as the two of us have similar characteristcs, just two different way of showing. Tilly shows a very marked up version of her life, where I don’t show my life all together. I wonder if that’s a general characteristcs in our population too, trying to match our life to an Instagram self (which is ego).</p><img src="../images/oj-2024-09/iceberg.png" alt="An article about psychoanalysis" style=""><span class="image-caption">An article about psychoanalysis</span><p>Crystal talked about this idea of id, ego, and superego through psychoanalysis, and I saw this graph. My thought right now is life is about aligning the three more and more, and ability to show all three at somepoint, what we call maturing?</p>]]></content>

SF is getting hot near end of July, and not having sweat stain on the back of the head felt nice.</p><p>When I was in pre-school the sentiments teacher taught was ‘一屋不扫，何以扫天下’ to encourage us to tighten our personal space regularly.

I also think the many rejection emails that comes my way did drop my confidence &#x2F; affected performance.</p><p>So been in a new place stimulated my brain once more. I went on a hike, city walked, and read once again after a very, very long time.</p><p>Going back to the previous topic I felt like there is the enviorment (the country &#x2F; city you are in), and a sub enviorment (your local activity zone), and yourself. Getting a haircut was directly a change on myself, and going to vancouver was the enviorment itself, the greater the change the bigger the sti mulates? I am still thinking about the hireachies (if there is still any).</p><p>The price of everything in Canada is so cheap btw, Tilly went on a shopping sphree at th ewarehouse, I was amazed.</p><h3 id="Friends-helps-me-to-stay-motivated-part-II"><a href="#Friends-helps-me-to-stay-motivated-part-II" class="headerlink" title="Friends helps me to stay motivated, part II"></a>Friends helps me to stay motivated, part II</h3><img src="../images/oj-2024-08/cake.jpg" alt="Tilly's birthday had 20+ attendees, I've never seen so many in my life, image unrelated" style=""><span class="image-caption">Tilly's birthday had 20+ attendees, I've never seen so many in my life, image unrelated</span><p>One of the podcast I lisented on the trip dived into the idea of ‘free time’, TLDR 2-5 hours of free time per day is nice, for other times one should work on something that has a goal &#x2F; fulfilling.</p><p>Thinking that’s partly why job hunting (especially after college) tend to be difficult &#x2F; consuming, for one you would have much more than 5 hours so feeling unproductive, for the other the result isn’t linear (there is no visible goals) so feeling unmotivated</p><p>It’s very difficult to jump directly out of the cycle (since it’s a larger abstract enviroment we are in), but one thing I start to appreciate it’s the geniue support from close friends.</p><p>Recall 2019 going to college mom &amp; dad always say ‘make friendos’, when things are going downhills for you and there are still people you can reachout to (even craizer, reaches out to you), unswayed by your statues, and listens to whatever you have to say, I found this to be very securing :)</p><p>I just realized last month I wrote exactly the same thing, intersting hahah.</p>]]></content>

Thinking back on this jounrey, I tend to always want to find shortcuts in life, not realizing they will come and bite back to me someday.</p><p>And with that a reflection for change: fundenmental skills (English, PM methdologies, Python etc) I should learn as early as possible, because later on 1) I will be less motivated to learn 2) it would be particually useless as my brain has settled 3) it take extreme effort to change myself again.</p><h3 id="Living-Graciously"><a href="#Living-Graciously" class="headerlink" title="Living Graciously"></a>Living Graciously</h3><img src="../images/oj-2024-07/lemon-tart.jpg" alt="Lemon Tart I got for almost free :)" style=""><span class="image-caption">Lemon Tart I got for almost free :)</span><p>数字游民(cyber hobo?) was a term pretty popular on X, now that I’ve stacked the debuff of graduation jobless and living in SF, I soon to myself living in exactly what was the definition of cyber hobo life lol.</p><p>On a very positive note, I found how cheap it is to live a life maintaining a high standard of living quality</p><p>Living - Reduced by 40.7%, I started to divde up the original purpose of a ‘house’, now I live in a very cheap 1 bed space (only for sleeping &amp; storage), work in a public co-working space, workout &amp; shower at the gym, and eat through Trader Joe’s grocery &amp; ready to eat meals.</p><p>Communting - Reduced by around 30%, I take the combination of bart&#x2F;muni&#x2F;bus everyday, and purchased a Lyft bike pass to finish the last mile. The most noticible part is actually communiting time, I was able to commute probably 10% faster even with the reduction in price.</p><p>Purchases - I spent quite little on clothes&#x2F;items but recently I found people on facebook market selling almost new item at 20% of price, which also became a saving :)</p><p>The popular saying I always get to hear was ‘happiness and money are seperated’, which I always laugh as I thought this is the saying of these who are previleged. I am changed a little though, perhaps it’s much easier than I thought to live a gracious life with a bit of research.</p><p>…</p><p>Now none of the saving mentioned above actually became savings, last time I checked my spending with Tilly</p><p>it went up by 200+% :)</p><h3 id="Friends-helps-me-to-stay-motivated"><a href="#Friends-helps-me-to-stay-motivated" class="headerlink" title="Friends helps me to stay motivated"></a>Friends helps me to stay motivated</h3><img src="../images/oj-2024-07/chloe-site.png" alt="Check out the site at chloeyan.me" style=""><span class="image-caption">Check out the site at chloeyan.me</span><p>I caught up with 6 friends last week and felt motivated again.</p><p>I am somewhat introverted, most time I prefer spending time with myself. When this goes long enough, I often has this feeling of turning into a bystander of this world, makes me more reluctant to act &amp; change my situation</p><p>Talking &amp; catching up with friends drags me back to the world though, listening to their updates in life makes me 1) happy for their changes &amp; 2) excited to change myself too</p><p>I’ve recently saw a saying that talking with friends is like the universe presenting you with a ‘you’ in the parallel universe, showing you who you can become, and encourage to take a step, I found it to be very kind :)</p><p>Remember my mom always say ‘生活大部分都是柴米油盐;, I am fortunate enough to have friends who I get to talk to and push me back to act in life.</p>]]></content>

Most of the time I would use trainers to beat the game, shortening the time of grinding. The last game I really ‘played’ was a mobile game called Infinity Blade II back in 2015, where I beat every boss, collected all items through myself.</p><p>…</p><p>Talked with Tilly and she mentioned two types of people in this world, those who focus on the result and those who focus on the journey. It made me wonder if playing games would have been more enjoyable if I never learned coding, I don’t think so.</p><p>I still enjoy beating games, just in my own way now. It’s less about journey or result oriented, as long as you are having fun, whatever way works.</p><p>Trainers aside, this month I’ve reached the highest and the lowest rank in two games, on Hearthstone I enjoyed the result, and League I enjoyed the journey :)</p><img src="../images/oj-2023-10/hearthstone.png" alt="" style=""><img src="../images/oj-2023-10/league.png" alt="" style=""><h3 id="Baking-assumptions-start-small"><a href="#Baking-assumptions-start-small" class="headerlink" title="Baking, assumptions, start small"></a>Baking, assumptions, start small</h3><p>Bill made crepe cake the other day, I took a stab at it myself.</p><img src="../images/oj-2023-10/crepe-cake.png" alt="I am dead" style=""><span class="image-caption">I am dead</span><p>Found myself subpar in baking, though more so on following instructions. While living with Chen he once mentioned ‘cooking is an art, and baking is a science’, since for baking you have to follow the exact instruction, step by step.</p><p>Truth is there is no science in my world lol. When I was little my parent bought me a LEGO boat, I ended up making a plane out of it :)</p><p>…</p><p>The main difference is about making assumptions thinking now, I had trouble distinguishing if something was from the article or myself (hence agreeing with everything I see). University has helped tremendously, stand ups, MVPs, giving me ways to frequently check assumptions and stay reliable.</p><p>…</p><p>As much to my despair, there is still, science and logic in this world. And linking this back to baking, one lesson I learned is to start small. With 1&#x2F;4 of the ingredient I could have known heavy cream is not the same as light cream, and a pinch of baking soda doesn’t equal to none just because I don’t have any.</p>]]></content>

So about 3-4% in additional AUM.  - Increase in trading fees due to more trades.

When the girl kept advancing in life while the boy stood still, how much did that influence the final outcome of the relationship.</p><p>Summer does seem like the breakup season; most people around me are single while writing this.

The good news was many were happy to meet up; the even better news was too many were happy to meet lol, ended up grouping many of the meetups.</p><p>One of the characteristics of ‘introvertedness’ is preferring one on one, deeper conversations, so it was a brand-new experience going into a Chinese home kitchen in a party of 6, listening to the conversation shifting from K-Pop idol to the financial state of the US, and back to K-pop idol (yes, there are apparently 13).</p><p>…</p><p>Though friends are individual dots and networks are friends that know each other, I wanted to do these sort of ‘friends gatherings’ more, connecting different people together, see a different side of them.</p><img src="../images/oj-2023-07/tilly-kinshuk.jpg" alt="guess how many friends were suppose to be in the frame :)" style=""><span class="image-caption">guess how many friends were suppose to be in the frame :)</span><h3 id="Airplane-WiFi"><a href="#Airplane-WiFi" class="headerlink" title="Airplane WiFi"></a>Airplane WiFi</h3><img src="../images/oj-2023-07/airplane.jpg" alt="小猪佩奇身上纹" style=""><span class="image-caption">小猪佩奇身上纹</span><p>All 5 plane rides I was on had in-plane wifi; you can watch shows, browse the internet just like when you are in the terminal. Every time the flight attendant proudly announces the plane equipped with wifi, I felt a bit of nostalgia, mind flashing back to 2019, handing the cashier ¥100 paper bill for the first time back in China, the guy’s eyes widened, pointed to the QR code on the screen and said:</p><p>‘Do you not have WeChat Pay?’</p><p>…</p><p>Not just wifi, more and more places have signals now, underground metros, tunnels, elevators. I never consider myself living under a rock, but it’s always exciting to see these quality of life changes slowly happening around life.</p><p>I didn’t use the in-plane wifi though. With more and more responsibilities on my plate, the 4-hour plane ride felt like the only time I get to disconnect from my world and recharge, where I can sleep, daydream, or just look at the clouds, allow my mind to float in peace, think of whatever I want before landing.</p><p>Listened on the Huberman’s Lab that the best productivity app on the phone is airplane mode, perhaps there is some merit in detaching yourself from the world, recollect, so one can better move on through the journey :)</p><p>2019 年我没有本地号码所以用不了微信支付。好心的大叔帮我联系了楼上的外公，并在他下来替我付钱之前的那半小时，在小卖部里和我说起了新中国成立的故事。</p>]]></content>

Whenever I get stuck, would simply take a pause and look out at the kids playing in the field, practicing for their games. Reminded of grandpa who would often take me to the park when I was little, sitting at the bench talking with his friends, while watching me running around the playground like a tiny madman lol.</p><p>It’s a shift of workstyle for sure, about a year ago I often perferred sitting in an underground library, focusing only on the work in front. I was more productive back then for sure, but I am unsure which one is better. It feels pleasent having the option to sense the energy from the court, noticing something more than just yourself and the computer.</p><p>My grandpa was never really a spectator at heart, in heated moments he would often join the battle and run around with me at the park, quite fitting to someone his character lol.</p><h3 id="Being-a-leader-credit-and-responsibilities"><a href="#Being-a-leader-credit-and-responsibilities" class="headerlink" title="Being a leader, credit and responsibilities."></a>Being a leader, credit and responsibilities.</h3><img src="../images/oj-2023-04/patcmu.png" alt="ditto the message" style=""><span class="image-caption">ditto the message</span><p>P@CMU started board recruitment for the coming year, where I got to take the lead.

The time where I missed the outreach for professor for our professor chat event, remember the first thing he said was ‘apologize…as we failed to motivate and facilite you’.</p><p>Putting down the desire to showoff, stay responsible to set others for success, a pretty valuable lessoned learned.</p><h3 id="Bill-Ant-relationships"><a href="#Bill-Ant-relationships" class="headerlink" title="Bill, Ant, relationships"></a>Bill, Ant, relationships</h3><img src="../images/oj-2023-04/tocaya.jpg" alt="tocaya nachos, they have really good chips and drinks, would recommend :)" style=""><span class="image-caption">tocaya nachos, they have really good chips and drinks, would recommend :)</span><p>Went to a bar with Anthony and Bill before the semester ended, ordered a few drinks and talked about summer plans, life, and relationships.</p><p>Bill is a firm believer that relationship is something he would only look after he settles a bit more. It’s like, the center piece of the jigsaw puzzle, no mean to push the centerpiece so soon, knowing that everyone will be different comes to the time of graduation.</p><p>Anthony in the meanwhile, is somewhat engaged in a relationship. For him it’s nice to spend time together with someone, sharing differnt parts of life and growing together.</p><p>Both of them are right as it matters more of what you want, does got me think a bit more. After the failed confession, have being putting more focus on myself. Still organizing my thought though, I do believe that through every interaction I get a clearer understanding of myself, and that along should be an asset, not a cost.</p><p>Didn’t order a drink so it really was only the two guys talking lol, surprised how much alcohol does to someone.</p><h3 id="Gap-semester-cross-road-choices-in-life"><a href="#Gap-semester-cross-road-choices-in-life" class="headerlink" title="Gap semester, cross road, choices in life"></a>Gap semester, cross road, choices in life</h3><img src="../images/oj-2023-04/cmu-cmu.jpg" alt="the CMU sign for seniors to take photos with, previously thought they were AR objects lol" style=""><span class="image-caption">the CMU sign for seniors to take photos with, previously thought they were AR objects lol</span><p>With some back and forth decied to take a gap semester in F23. When clicking sent email on my leave of absense email, can sense mixed feeling arose in my heart.</p><p>Part of me are excited about this new oppotunities, this chance to be more unique among people I know; at the same time, this slight fear of being alone in a new enviorment, doing everything on my own.</p><p>It’s intersting to think I like to have choices, but like less on commiting to one. While deciding my F23 semester felt like I was sitting at the middle of an intersection, waiting, hoping that the different path would merge into one.</p><p>More so of a discovery than anything else, have learned to give imagination and reality their own space, keeping their independence.

Went to the window and you could hear sirens, helicopters, and people shouting around the area.</p><p>…so I untied my shoes, changed cloth, and laid flat on my bed waiting for updates. 20 minutes later the university sent us a text, the event was a hoax and all on-campus activities resumed in session.</p><p>I didn’t get up though, and I wasn’t the only one lol. Almost all campus activities went to remote for the rest of the day despite no threat. Later chatting with friends and they mentioned today being ‘emotionally draining’, only then was I able to find the text to label my emotions. This sense of exhaustion after high level of anxiety, I ended up binge watching a movie for the day.</p><p>July 2022 I wrote about procrasination and the quote:</p><blockquote><p>Like everything else worthwhile, successful investing demands a price. But its currency is not dollars and cents. It’s volatility, fear, doubt, uncertainty, and regret- all of which are easy to overlook until you’re dealing with them in real time.</p></blockquote><p>This semester have valued physical wellness, a good reminder to take of myself emotionally too.</p><h3 id="Offer-decision-providing-values"><a href="#Offer-decision-providing-values" class="headerlink" title="Offer, decision, providing values"></a>Offer, decision, providing values</h3><img src="../images/oj-2023-03/late-night-work-session.jpg" alt="placeholder" style=""><span class="image-caption">placeholder</span><p>Tuesday night got a call right before going to bed from someone from work, thought it was work related so picked it up and all of a sudden on the other end of the phone.</p><blockquote><p>SEAN HELLLLP</p></blockquote><p>(It was probably less dramatic but) the person was trying to decide on two offers lol, one being something they love doing, the other paying significantly more. From there they talked about their roller coaster recruiting cycle this year, adding on ending a 5 year relationship, relatives passing away, and many many more.</p><p>The chat went about an hour and a half, and when the person hung up I sat on the chair with two arms hanging on the side, baffled. I don’t think I helped them make a decision in the end, I mostly just listened.</p><p>Dad’s thought on ‘success are only tags’ went through my mind right before I fell asleep on the desk lol. Success is just tags that allow more people to notice you, it’s the value that you provide that really matters.</p><p>Woke up again at 3 am and saw the thank you text from the person, feeling validated.</p><h3 id="What-do-I-want-tradeoffs"><a href="#What-do-I-want-tradeoffs" class="headerlink" title="What do I want, tradeoffs"></a>What do I want, tradeoffs</h3><p>Now what I didn’t say to the person was, I am in a similar situation as well, trying to decide between work, another gap semester, or simply graduate with the degree :&#x2F;</p><p>The first question Tilly asked after hearing all this was ‘what do you want’, and I think that single question helped solve the problem lol. Knowing what I want, understanding what I will lose based on it, and being fine with it, I think I’ve figured my path out.</p><p>Related read, <a href="https://sspai.com/post/77685">花生酱先生 - 把人生活成旷野</a>，<a href="https://www.notion.so/yizeshen/c84507a3a88f4e3eb149c5552587dd42?pvs=4">fonter - 想要真正拥有一样事物</a>.</p><h3 id="ChatGPT-efficiency-work-life-balance"><a href="#ChatGPT-efficiency-work-life-balance" class="headerlink" title="ChatGPT, efficiency, work life balance"></a>ChatGPT, efficiency, work life balance</h3><img src="../images/oj-2023-03/chatgpt-capstone.png" alt="capstone team formation with ChatGPT" style=""><span class="image-caption">capstone team formation with ChatGPT</span><p>Steven introduced ChatGPT back in February and started using it ever since, looking at the web, OpenAI seems to be what everyone is talking about right now.</p><p>The hype does feel reasonable to me, I became much more efficient on my tasks with ChatGPT, and I am still in the early stage of discovering its capabilities. Reminded of the saying that ‘AI will not replace human, but people who use AI will’</p><p>The funny thing though, although I was able to become more efficient with my work, I didn’t really get ‘free-er’, more work just piled on top of my todo, no matter how fast I did my work.</p><p>This sudden thought that the tasks may be ‘neverending’, did get me to think back on work-life balance a bit more. Back in Jan 2022 realized that the goal post of ‘successful’ is evershifting, good to discover that the goal post for ‘done’ is about the same.</p><img src="../images/oj-2023-03/chatgpt-ta.jpg" alt="bonus, 112 TAs at their finest :D" style=""><span class="image-caption">bonus, 112 TAs at their finest :D</span>]]></content>

So now whenever people show up to get food, they simply have to take out their phone and scan the code to register, saves both cost and waiting time.</p><p>As we proudly presented the solution to Raja the day after, he listened for a while, scratched his half-bolded head back and forth, looked down at the solution proposal then us, and said with a slow yet disappointing tone</p><blockquote><p>It is an efficient solution, not an effective one though</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>…Imagine yourself as a waiter who just lost your job, now without a salary or tip, you have to put aside your pride, wait in line for hours just to get basic food to sustain yourself for a week. Now that you are in front of the line, would you prefer a cardboard cutout with a giant QR code, or a person smiling while handing you a warm cookie, asking how your life has been?</p></blockquote><p>I track the time that I spend through toggl, for about two years and I see little improvements in my actual life. Raja’s thought on efficiency + effectiveness lingered in my head, perhaps toggl and time management is only a tool, it was never the end goal.</p><p>Wenhao said I never really had an end goal, I chase what people around me want instead. Currently planning on taking another gap semester F23, started asking myself ‘what do I want’ knowing I will be entirely detached from the envrioment of university soon.</p><p>Back to the project though, we ended up taking the advice and went with a basic solution. It felt a bit ironic that, after learning Python SQL Ruby on Rails (and many others), the ideal solution for us turns out to be volunteers handing people warm cookies, quite a good lessson on empathy lol.</p><img src="../images/oj-2023-02/food-bank-group-pic.jpg" alt="Our professor heard about us wanting to visit the food bank, drove us there, back, and bought us lunch :')" style=""><span class="image-caption">Our professor heard about us wanting to visit the food bank, drove us there, back, and bought us lunch :')</span><h3 id="Wenhao-learning-too-slow-learning-too-much"><a href="#Wenhao-learning-too-slow-learning-too-much" class="headerlink" title="Wenhao, learning too slow, learning too much"></a>Wenhao, learning too slow, learning too much</h3><img src="../images/oj-2023-02/wenhao-nonviolent-communication.jpeg" alt="Non-violent Communication, Wenhao's recc" style=""><span class="image-caption">Non-violent Communication, Wenhao's recc</span><p>Got to chat with Wenhao middle of this month, I mentioned this frustration about learning too slowly despite knowing my goal. Showed him how I track articles I read and asked what systems he use, Wenhao slanted his head, thought for a bit and was like</p><blockquote><p>I don’t :D</p></blockquote><p>…</p><p>知其然而不知其所以然 was what we came to, instead of learning too slow, I might’ve been learning too much. I read articles that expose me to new ideas, but I rarely stop and study the core concept behind them.</p><p>Remember back in middle school we once performed at Disney. While rehearsing at the back side of the stage, I for the first time saw how the stage was being set up. Fast forward to now it felt like the same scene, I only glimpsed at the scene without actually going to the back, learning how it was pieced together.</p><p>It’s not only knowing how important something is, and also giving yourself the availability to sit down, the time to learn and condence.</p><img src="../images/oj-2023-02/book-notes.png" alt="Took the advice and start reading books instead, thinking now, isn't books just a collection of articles lol" style=""><span class="image-caption">Took the advice and start reading books instead, thinking now, isn't books just a collection of articles lol</span><h3 id="Money-tracking-motivations"><a href="#Money-tracking-motivations" class="headerlink" title="Money tracking, motivations"></a>Money tracking, motivations</h3><img src="../images/oj-2023-02/ynab-monthly.png" alt="It turns out I spend $413.91 on subscriptions per month, I was greatly shooked, small money does adds up :D" style=""><span class="image-caption">It turns out I spend $413.91 on subscriptions per month, I was greatly shooked, small money does adds up :D</span><p>This month started tracking spending using YNAB specifically on the money I get being a TA this semester.</p><p>In January I got $453 for the hours I worked, checked the account mid Feburary thinking it would be just enough to buy the ticket back to California</p><p>…and there was $17.35 shivering at the corner of the account lol Thanks again mom for sponsoring the trip :’)</p><p>Back to tracking spending, was a bit surprised how well it stuck to my routine. YNAB did a great job eliminating the fear of spending not according to plan’, allowing you to shift around budget whenever you wish to, which became part of the fun for me throughout the planning :D</p><p>Understanding the importance and having the availability, the third thing on Wenhao’s equation on getting things done was motivations.</p><p>‘If you ain’t having fun you ain’t doing it right’, Wenhao said with stars in his eyes. The first two give you enough momentum to start, where making things fun gives you the energy to continue for a long, long time.</p><p>Deleting people tab makes a lot more sense when explained by Wenhao’s equation, I know it’s important and put much thoughts into it, however, I was carried away by fear and sunken cost instead of the joy of knowing the people around me, hence the reason why I stopped.</p><h3 id="Study-together-frictions-in-life"><a href="#Study-together-frictions-in-life" class="headerlink" title="Study together, frictions in life"></a>Study together, frictions in life</h3><img src="../images/oj-2023-02/grinder-squad.jpg" alt="Studying with friends at the HCII lounge, from left to right: Julianna, Anthony, Bill" style=""><span class="image-caption">Studying with friends at the HCII lounge, from left to right: Julianna, Anthony, Bill</span><p>Finished the first three sections of the blog while studying with a few friends. Sitting at the HCII lounge, sliding airpods back to the case, the smell of pad thai from the to go box Julianna just heated up, abruptive curses coming out from Bill flaming his capstone teammates, the crsip, gentle click from Anthony’s mouse shifting between tabs, the room was filled with life and joy lol.</p><p>Ever since high school I prefer to study alone in quiet, eliminating any distractions on doing my own work. Working with these folks the past few weeks has been very pleasant though, this feeling of, life slowing down? It felt like I got a chance to look around, learning things that’s not related to my goal.</p><p>Tilly mentioned the secret of staying young is constantly trying new things, because when we do we let our brain run at full capacity to adapt, making time feel slower.</p><p>Right now it’s just a feeling but, I sensed this urge to experience more of these ‘frictions’. Of course without it I got more things done but, these weeks felt like sliding through thin layers of ice, quiet without making a sound.</p>]]></content>

For school, it’s a lot of back-and-forth drafts, and for blog, I tend to think with a blank page for hours, before I put a single words on.</p><blockquote><p>想到五分就开干，干到八分你就整明白了。</p></blockquote><p>Via <a href="https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/7mDyF_v5OzpMhrmBzI-Pyw">MacTalk - 41 个新年开工工作建议</a>. I’ve heard similar term called ‘fill the canvas’, putting it in plain words, two shitty drafts are better than one well-done one.</p><p>So yeah, started from this issue I wrote with much less thinking, so far I am on the fifth draft which took me an overall, 45 minutes :)</p><p>Dad taught me 谋定而后动 and realized I’ve done the exact opposite. Right now I felt more aligned with ‘letting out action before words’, perhaps age and experience do matter in this regard.</p><h3 id="Seattle-trip-making-deletions-in-life"><a href="#Seattle-trip-making-deletions-in-life" class="headerlink" title="Seattle trip, making deletions in life"></a>Seattle trip, making deletions in life</h3><img src="../images/oj-2023-01/double-rainbow-seattle.jpeg" alt="we saw double rainbows after the sky cleared up" style=""><span class="image-caption">we saw double rainbows after the sky cleared up</span><p>In Seattle we were walking outside one day when the storm hit. We decided to stick with our plan and it took us so much energy, I couldn’t complete my last task for that day - picking up our friend from the airport.</p><p>Laying in bed feeling a bit guilty, thought to myself, we really put too much on the plan. With everything that people recommended to us we wanted to check out all the places, we ended up spreading ourselves too thin.</p><p>Thinking back to previous semesters at school, it has always been easier to do more, adding more things to my agenda. There seemed to be too many things that I wanted, to the point that I wasn’t able to focus on any.</p><p>What do I want out of my time, and how should I prioritize, that was the seed that was left, while staring at the cream ceiling of the empty master bedroom.</p><img src="../images/oj-2023-01/seattle-gang.jpg" alt="people I was with on the trip, us cooking dinner together :)" style=""><span class="image-caption">people I was with on the trip, us cooking dinner together :)</span><h3 id="Deleting-people-tab"><a href="#Deleting-people-tab" class="headerlink" title="Deleting people tab"></a>Deleting people tab</h3><img src="../images/oj-2023-01/people-tab.png" alt="in case anyone curious what the people tab is, it's a place for me to keep track of when I talked with each person" style=""><span class="image-caption">in case anyone curious what the people tab is, it's a place for me to keep track of when I talked with each person</span><p>Basically the title. After the trip got back to my dorm on a Sunday night, while drawing names down had this sudden thought to myself, did I reach out to them because I wanted to, or did I reach out to them because their time was up on the tab?</p><p>I wasn’t able to tell the difference, and again the sense of exhaustion kicked in.</p><p>Partly because how the spreadsheet was set up, though more so because of how I maintained it. Felt through time I started to reach out of fear, not wanting to lose connection with people I have.</p><p>Looking at the ceiling while notion takes its time deleting the spreadsheet, I wonder if there is another way to do it, instead of keeping people as a spreadsheet, write about them.</p><h3 id="绕了一圈-growing-up"><a href="#绕了一圈-growing-up" class="headerlink" title="绕了一圈, growing up"></a>绕了一圈, growing up</h3><p>Before I was born, one day my mom went to the bank to deposit her check, and as she walked in the front door, she saw this 25ish man with an older lady, appeared to be her mom, leaning forward at the front desk, as the lady asked for job opportunities they have for her son.</p><p>Of course you don’t just get a job at a bank by asking the teller, as the pair walked out of the door, disappointed, my mom heard the son wining ‘if you would have pushed me a bit more, I would never have been like this’.</p><p>That’s the story I heard while growing up, as my mom would often say</p><blockquote><p>他变老了，但他没有长大</p></blockquote><p>and with time, growing old and not growing up also became part of my fear. With the people tab deleted, laying flat on my chair, I can feel fear creeping into my mind, as I realized a year and a half of maintaining the spreadsheet, I came back with nothing.</p><p>And then I thought to myself, what is 长大, and what is, growing up?</p><img src="../images/oj-2023-01/growth-weichen.jpg" alt="placeholder" style=""><span class="image-caption">placeholder</span><p>Something drawn by Weichen, the process of experience -&gt; reflect -&gt; label -&gt; act, or as my dad often says to me, 螺旋升天 lol.</p><p>Now that I have had the experience, just have to reflect on how I can do better, felt relieved when I thought about that.</p>]]></content>

Every morning I would get up, pick a city I wish to go to, go there and only after that spontaneously pick a coffee shop I want to check out.</p><p>The past year have been very intentional with life, and perhaps the biggest lesson out of it was, I simply can’t. Felt stressed when things didn’t go as planned and only felt relief when they did, this anxiety lingered towards the end of the semester.</p><p>So yeah, started letting the unpredictable part of the world come into my life, working at a coffee shop instead of the room as a first step, as what Bill said, living a more laxed life.</p><p>All that being said, I actually don’t drink coffee lol, Qingyang suggest order latte with no shots, wonder if that’s a fancy way to say milk lol.</p><h3 id="Reading-spaced-repetition"><a href="#Reading-spaced-repetition" class="headerlink" title="Reading, spaced repetition"></a>Reading, spaced repetition</h3><img src="../images/oj-2022-12/progressive-sum.png" alt="I use Notion to track the article + times that I have read them, would recommend too :)" style=""><span class="image-caption">I use Notion to track the article + times that I have read them, would recommend too :)</span><p>Back during TAing, Kosbie told us the first day that TA is not just good for the students, but also ‘good for yourself.’</p><p>‘You see’, guy slowly walking from one end of the room to another, ‘while teaching students you essentially learned the material again, a few times of these you will never forget :-)’’</p><p>Later learned a similar concept called spaced repetition, and practiced it during this break, reading comments I left for myself in articles, for the first time I sensed growth with myself this year, getting different insights out every time I read on the same article was quite fascinating.</p><p>For guide on spaced repetition, found this <a href="https://fortelabs.com/blog/progressive-summarization-a-practical-technique-for-designing-discoverable-notes/">progressive summarization how to</a> very helpful, would recommend :)</p><h3 id="Capstone-team-formation-birds-eye-and-frogs-eye"><a href="#Capstone-team-formation-birds-eye-and-frogs-eye" class="headerlink" title="Capstone team formation, birds eye and frogs eye"></a>Capstone team formation, birds eye and frogs eye</h3><img src="../images/oj-2022-12/bird-eye-view.jpg" alt="placeholder bird eye view :)" style=""><span class="image-caption">placeholder bird eye view :)</span><blockquote><p>Remember, everyone you meet is afraid of something, loves something, and has lost something.</p></blockquote><p>Team formation for Capstone happens next week, in the form we let the student pick two students who they don’t wish to work with. Checked the responses yesterday and, one name almost everyone in their department put down as their anti-preference.</p><p>I’ve seen this student’s work before and he is really, really good at his job, previously imagined everyone wanting to work with him, so at first thought I read it wrong lol.</p><p>Writing this not to dig around reason why, got reminded of the concept of ‘bird’s eye’ and ‘frog’s eye’. I was so close up with CMU that, only until this TA opportunity that I learned we are all just regular people, as Weichen said, the better we are at something, the less attention we get to put on something else.</p><p>We are all equal in time, makes me rethink on what I want to prioritize on.</p><h3 id="Daily-album-2022-in-review"><a href="#Daily-album-2022-in-review" class="headerlink" title="Daily album, 2022 in review"></a>Daily album, 2022 in review</h3><img src="../images/oj-2022-12/sean-impression.png" alt="highlight for 12/19, thanks Crystal :)" style=""><span class="image-caption">highlight for 12/19, thanks Crystal :)</span><p>This is the second year I kept a daily album, where each day I would pick one photo that marks as the highlight, and revisit them all at the last day of the year. A few thoughts popped up after seeing the album for 2022</p><blockquote><p>人并不是活一辈子，而是活几个瞬间</p></blockquote><p>The highlight for most of my days didn’t bring many thoughts, I went and revisited the 2021 album, there were some I didn’t even remember the reason I marked them as highlights. While thinking ‘nothing matters in the long run’, starts to resonate with what Crystal said more and more, we don’t live a life but rather a few moments within it.</p><blockquote><p>life is a picture, but you live in a pixel</p></blockquote><p>Quite the contrary of the first thought, realized the album helped to, ‘flatten’ a year almost? Instead of a few dramatic moments&#x2F;shades of color I recall, fulfillment while carrying 3 bags of groceries up 17 floors, emptiness as the only person sitting in the library Saturday morning, affection after chatting with a friend for hours while sitting on their apartment floor, the smaller moments started coming together, adding more gradients to the picture.</p><p>…and that’s a wrap for 2022! Made a small promise to myself to update for a year and have successfully fulfilled it. For those who are reading a small thank you, the amount of support I got kept me going through many, many times that I was about to skip&#x2F;stop, thanks for reading, for the genuine feedback, and the experience you all shared after.</p><p>I am still ideating how I would approach this blog start from now on but, will keep you posted on my ongoing journey :).</p>]]></content>

I would be the kind of guy that asks ‘what do you want for your birthday and just get the gift, not realizing that it’s the feeling of being remembered and cared for that matters more. Nicole mentioned multiple time that ‘it’s just a feeling and Steve simply refers me as ‘研磨间的驴’, guess they do have a point lol.</p><p>More so an observation than a reflection, I understood myself better when I interacted with someone else. I tend to be transparent with my thought, choosing to be silent when I feel insecure, and currently in the process of feeling the more emotional side of things.</p><p>So in the end, jump off the bus a few stops early, ran to the corner and called an uber, told the driver I was too lazy to walk the 5-minute walk and she believed it :D</p><h3 id="Helen-confidence-I-will"><a href="#Helen-confidence-I-will" class="headerlink" title="Helen, confidence, I will"></a>Helen, confidence, I will</h3><img src="../images/oj-2022-10/scott-hall.png" alt="Scott Hall where I usually work with Helen" style="width:50%; height:50%;"><span class="image-caption">Scott Hall where I usually work with Helen</span><p>Helen absolutely hates it when people say ‘I hope’ or ‘I wish’, she mentioned these words meant carelessness and fear of taking responsibility.</p><p>I tend to use these words when I feel uncertain and want to be safe, thinking now, these phrases directly translate to a lack of confidence.</p><p>While I was learning PARA read similar things, when creating a project you should look for a verb that describes done, finalize, submit, making the action transparent and yourself accountable</p><p>The way we present matters just as much as the material itself was I came to, so started using phrases that boost confidence, namely ‘I will’. ‘I will make a plan for the trip’ and ‘I will resolve this bug and push a PR’ in itself gives me more confidence and certainty, alerting me to complete it.</p><p>And I was that ‘people’ at the beginning of the story by the way lol, appreciate the lesson and thought, life really is an ongoing journey.</p><h3 id="Shortcuts-perfecting-the-basics"><a href="#Shortcuts-perfecting-the-basics" class="headerlink" title="Shortcuts, perfecting the basics"></a>Shortcuts, perfecting the basics</h3><img src="../images/oj-2022-10/shelly-you.png" alt="part of our app mock ups" style=""><span class="image-caption">part of our app mock ups</span><p>Got a chance to design phone apps and through found that, I went with minimalistic styles because I simply don’t have the basic skills of laying out things differently, I can’t do another style.</p><p>That was just the start beginning lol, after I signed the internship started doing competitive analysis with Jimmy, and disturbingly, I had no idea where to begin to dissect an app knowing that I would be a product manager intern soon, the question marks on Jimmy’s head when I told him I don’t know where to start :’)</p><p>I am a strong believer of ‘half ass with everything you got’, but recently wondered if I’ve taken too many shortcuts to get to where I am today, ignoring the basics that come before the fancy title&#x2F;result.</p><p>An opposite example for me was TAing, every recitation I would list out three key points, and practice saying them in front of a mirror, the most basic part of presentation. Crystal mentioned that I have something called ‘亲和力’, imagined it was through the time that I practiced saying words while being a TA lol.</p><p>Thinking about perfecting the basics, mind went to the dance tutorials on moving legs + shoulders Nicole sent, I will put more emphasis on these starting now.</p><h3 id="Thomas-self-development-accepting-yourself"><a href="#Thomas-self-development-accepting-yourself" class="headerlink" title="Thomas, self development, accepting yourself"></a>Thomas, self development, accepting yourself</h3><img src="../images/oj-2022-10/catman-walk.jpg" alt="After the chat went out for a walk and felt, relived" style="width:50%; height:50%;"><span class="image-caption">After the chat went out for a walk and felt, relived</span><p>Chat with Thomas this month and talked to him about this frustration, knowing that I put heavy effort into self development, yet yielded little results.</p><p>About 20 minutes of rant Thomas just sat and listened, afterwards he talked about his 20s and the dramas he’s being through, summarized into one sentence</p><blockquote><p>You are enough of who you are</p></blockquote><p>And more importantly, surround yourself who also think you are enough.</p><p>I swear that’s not the thing he said lol, he mentioned time as a factor that I missed too, this phrase ‘good thing takes time’, I would get to practice it for a long time before it yields results (like workouts!).</p><p>So combining all together, continue improving myself (for the sake of improving myself), surround myself with people who accept me, and let time do their work.</p><p>I deserve to be loved without doing anything towards it, was one of the takeaways I learned through the conversation. Thomas good luck with your start-up and your relationship, I know things will turn out best for you in the end :)</p>]]></content>

Parties presents and cakes, these tends to excite me much less compared to others.</p><p>That is to say, still felt nice getting surprises though. Remember waking up in the afternoon seen Anita &amp; Elisa’s text with the bolded ‘HAPPY BIRTHDAY SEAN’, this warm and fuzzy feeling that I am on their mind, felt quite special.</p><p>And yes talking about special I did get myself a small slice of cheesecake, Xiaohan insisted it was a pie :’).</p><h3 id="Getting-COVID"><a href="#Getting-COVID" class="headerlink" title="Getting COVID"></a>Getting COVID</h3><img src="../images/oj-2022-09/uxa-welcome.jpg" alt="Since I wasn't able to join in person, UXA hosted a virtual welcome" style=""><span class="image-caption">Since I wasn't able to join in person, UXA hosted a virtual welcome</span><p>Started off with a pretty bad sore throat the second week in the afternoon, turned into a fever later into the night. Tested in the morning and yup, I was indeed positive lol.</p><p>First time having COVID so took around two and half weeks to recover, luckily I’ve gotten the booster shots so it really just felt like a mild fever.</p><p>Similar reflection towards birthday, appreciated the amount of care more than anything else. Professors handed me unlimited late days for the assignments I missed, Nicole brought groceries directly to my door, and Helen after sending ‘bitch don’t die’ rush over and dropped off enough Tylenol to take for the rest of my life (thank you all so much lol).</p><p>Thinking now, felt fortunate that no one I knew got COVID in the meantime, felt a sense of guilt&#x2F;unease imagining people around me getting it because of me…</p><h3 id="One-day-I-will-life-as-a-map"><a href="#One-day-I-will-life-as-a-map" class="headerlink" title="One day I will, life as a map"></a>One day I will, life as a map</h3><img src="../images/oj-2022-09/duolingo-rejection.png" alt="One of the many rejections that I've got" style="width:50%; height:50%;"><span class="image-caption">One of the many rejections that I've got</span><blockquote><p>Life is so much more about avoiding the wrong choices than making the right ones</p></blockquote><p>Wrote to myself that life is an infinite game <a href="https://yize.blog/20220920/#Mom-End-of-the-Line">this August</a> and realized I wasn’t following it at all lol. Now in the environment of school, I’ve again dwelling on a past that I can’t alter, worrying about a future I can’t predict.</p><p>Sure I told myself ‘live under the present’ just like <a href="https://yize.blog/20220920/#Mom-End-of-the-Line">this May</a> however, felt less helped as I am way too similar to the people I surround myself with rn, wanting the same thing and constantly comparing.</p><p>桌沿 mentioned life being a map instead of a track, that there is no such thing as the ‘right choice’, as we are all running towards different directions</p><blockquote><p>你我并未站在同一跑道上赛跑，我们遥遥相望，彼此鼓励和祝福，然后继续奔跑在广袤的地图之中、自己的人生道路之上。</p></blockquote><p>In the future think life as an infinite game, and in the present understand that we are running towards different goals, felt that’s the missing puzzle piece that I need.</p><h3 id="Talking-about-myself"><a href="#Talking-about-myself" class="headerlink" title="Talking about myself"></a>Talking about myself</h3><img src="../images/oj-2022-09/boston-ook-concert.jpg" alt="Felt nice being tall thanks mom" style="width:50%; height:50%;"><span class="image-caption">Felt nice being tall thanks mom</span><blockquote><p>不在于你写得是不是“我”，而在于你写的是不是“人”。</p></blockquote><p>Attended a concert at Boston during the weekend with some friends. While chatting with Angela she said</p><blockquote><p>Talking to you doesn’t feel like, talking to you?</p></blockquote><p>As funny as I felt, Anita mentioned the same thing once, I listen, rephrase and then quote other’s experiences in a conversation, avoiding touching myself in the process; the same pattern appears looking back at my blog, I often skip ‘I’s in a sentence, making the writing appear third person.</p><p>I felt, afraid?, talking about my point of view. When in conversations often bring forth the point instead of myself, and in writing I always try to stay objective.</p><p>Hence the reflection, knowing the people that I get to meet in the past few years, I want to be, more emotional almost? Saying more terms like ‘I think’ and ‘I feel’, doing things because I like them now, instead of thinking a year in the future.</p><blockquote><p>It doesn’t matter whether it’s first or third person, people care more about how much they can resonate with the experience you share, if they think you are human, you know.</p></blockquote><p>What Xiaohan said.</p>]]></content>

As he would reenforce every time we chat, ‘if you want to eat something go have it, if you fail the exam fuck the professors, if you need money ask grandpa’ he would say on repeat.</p><p>When little always wanted to be someone like grandpa, however, as time passes by, I am less of the kid back then. I start to notice people around me, their emotions and ways of thinking. Had a chat with Lucia and she described me as someone who is 优柔寡断, taking too long to make decisions.</p><p>I feel comfortable who I am now, though seen the changes, can’t help remembering back as a kid, sitting on his lap, at the balcony eating watermelons, his picture of this simple world:</p><blockquote><p>以后如果有人要是欺负你，你使劲干他就完事了.</p></blockquote><h2 id="Dad-Empathy-Fishing"><a href="#Dad-Empathy-Fishing" class="headerlink" title="Dad, Empathy, Fishing"></a>Dad, Empathy, Fishing</h2><p>Dad taught me two lessons on empathy. The first was ‘treat people the way you wish to be treated’. Remember he taught me this after an intense fight with a classmate back in kindergarten, and found the lesson helpful ever since.</p><p>That is, until I had my failed confession lol, as I was baffled on what I missed, so dad and I sat down, and he taught me the second lesson of his life.</p><p>The story goes like this: My dad, while little, went fishing by himself one day and caught nothing. That night he also got beat up because it turns out, he has used his favorite food (pork belly) as bait and used it all up.</p><blockquote><p>You know [my nickname], sometimes it’s about treating people the way they wish to be treated.</p></blockquote><p>And that’s the story of how I was helped lol, realizing that different people wish to be treated in different ways.</p><h2 id="Mom-End-of-the-Line"><a href="#Mom-End-of-the-Line" class="headerlink" title="Mom, End of the Line"></a>Mom, End of the Line</h2><p>Past couple of days my mom brought back up the infamous phrase</p><blockquote><p>I will finally be free after you graduate from college</p></blockquote><p>While feeling ironic ( because three years ago the sentence was ‘I will finally be free after you graduate from high school’), I also thought, perhaps I had the same mindset?</p><p>As for now my mind set has been, once I find an intern at a bigger tech company, the future of my life will be settled. But clearly that’s not the case lol, I’ve already switched my major twice at college, and my life post-college would only be longer + with more turbulence.</p><p>I wonder if it’s because I set my target too close in the future, hence this feeling that everything will be done once goals are achieved.</p><p>Jimmy taught me to see life as a game, an infinite game, because once you do, you will no longer be blinded by what everyone else is doing right now, and will keep going even after you didn’t hit your milestone.</p><p>Changing the current goal from ‘secure an intern’ to ‘become a better storyteller’, will keep myself updated on how it goes.</p>]]></content>

It was my last week in California, a sense of uncertainty was filling my heart. Talked to the doc about the 5 waitlisted classes next semester, people that I lost touch with during the summer, job hunts, post graduation plans, this feeling of, not wishing to sit around, but also unsure where I am heading to.</p><p>The doc, still operating the machine at the time, listened and nodded, letting out a few ‘mhm’ here and there. At the end after a long pause, she slowly let out ‘thanks for sharing, must take you a lot of courage to say these out loud’.</p><p>Felt a sudden sense of relief after hearing that lol, it mattered less whether she resonated with my thoughts, the fact she recognized my effort of saying these, that alone made me feel appreciated and content.</p><p>Wishing to be understood, thought if that’s one hidden goal I always had in mind.</p><p>07-19 update Jacqlyn said the doc was probably just asking how my teeth are I am on my way to jump off a cliff now</p><h3 id="Productivity-Double-Counting"><a href="#Productivity-Double-Counting" class="headerlink" title="Productivity, Double Counting"></a>Productivity, Double Counting</h3><img src="../images/oj-2022-07/the-psychology-of-money-mockup.jpg" alt="Book mockup I did, be happy to share the method if you are interested :D" style=""><span class="image-caption">Book mockup I did, be happy to share the method if you are interested :D</span><p>Let’s say you are walking on the street, and suddenly find this clean, crisp $100 sitting in the corner, you are very happy (hopefully?). So you went and bought 50 Big Macs (ate them in one go); an hour later you shopped five Uniqlo &amp; Spy X Family Collab shirts (and threw the receipt immediately). Both these goods cost around $100, and we just gave the same $100 bill two purposes, spending more than what we found.</p><p>Now let’s replace the phrase money with time, and that’s what we call procrastination lol.</p><p>Too often for me, early in the morning I would relax and plan to work afternoon, however by afternoon I choose to relax again instead of work, this cycle on and on.</p><p>Two things helped, first an article about envelopment budgeting:</p><blockquote><p>而每次有新的收入时（不管是固定薪水、稿酬、红包），都先进入「可用预算」，再明确地分配到一个或几个预算信封中，这样可以避免「得到一笔 1000 块的横财，却在五次消费时都认为自己花的是这笔钱」的幻觉。</p></blockquote><p>Via <a href="https://sspai.com/post/61367">摆脱超支困境，试试用这套「信封预算法」记账吧</a>.</p><p>This idea of ‘giving each dollar a purpose’ was inspiring, tried doing the same with time. Helen recommended Toggl to track times, has being pretty helpful.</p><p>The other, listened to The Psychology of Money again at the airport this week, resonated with this quote</p><blockquote><p>Like everything else worthwhile, successful investing demands a price. But its currency is not dollars and cents. It’s volatility, fear, doubt, uncertainty, and regret- all of which are easy to overlook until you’re dealing with them in real time.</p></blockquote><p>Replace investing with time management, realized I’ve written about this in <a href="https://yize.blog/20220228/#Let-Myself-be-Human-It%E2%80%99s-Okay-to-Feel-Down">allow myself to be human</a>, this thought on facing challenges instead of running away from it.</p><p>Interesting how similar money is to time, both finite, both we wish to maximize its value.</p><h3 id="Procrasination-People-I-Surround-Myself-With"><a href="#Procrasination-People-I-Surround-Myself-With" class="headerlink" title="Procrasination, People I Surround Myself With"></a>Procrasination, People I Surround Myself With</h3><img src="../images/oj-2022-07/keffi-doodle.jpg" alt="Placeholder, doodle for a friend’s goldendoodle" style="width:50%; height:50%;"><span class="image-caption">Placeholder, doodle for a friend’s goldendoodle</span><p>Felt clumsy last week of June, logged a total of 22 productive hours out of 168.

Recently realized I find joy&#x2F;support through people I surround myself with, and this pattern seems to appear: I am the most productive when I feel cared, when people around me are happy.</p><p>The second from chatting with mom.

Nancy took a gap year and learned Crypto, Chen spent weeks experimenting with the same recipes, Elliot coding 4 versions of an exercise before publishing.</p><p>When chatting with others I would sometimes have a voice in my quiet mind, screaming at me to ask follow ups, the smallest details my counterpart said. Perhaps the same gist here, but on things.</p><p>About 3 days later, saw a box of kiwi at the grocery store and searched the name’s origin, apparently kiwi was originated from China, wasn’t until it was exported to New Zealand that it got the name ‘kiwi’, as it’s similar to the kiwi bird on that land.</p><h3 id="Learning-connecting-teaching"><a href="#Learning-connecting-teaching" class="headerlink" title="Learning, connecting, teaching"></a>Learning, connecting, teaching</h3><blockquote><p>有一个很土的词儿叫「不忘初心」，大概也就是这么一个定义：回到你最初的需求，调整一种更合理的方式去为之努力，不要用「改变」来代替「纠正」。</p></blockquote><p>Via <a href="https://sspai.com/post/52930">情绪自救：把「自己」从情绪深渊中拯救出来</a>.

This vicious cycle of, procrastinating and feeling anxious towards it, Helen mentioned this word ‘内耗’.</p><p>Similar trend appeared before and, linking back to cooking <a href="https://yize.blog/20220325/#%E8%B1%86%E8%A7%92%E7%84%96%E9%9D%A2-Work-Life-Balance">豆角焖面</a>, this idea of enjoying the present moment seemed to be the solution.</p><p>Logically it made sense, though still felt this fear within me, shouldn’t I be doing something more productive, something more beneficial to my future?</p><p>Had quite a debate and, the answer I came to was, I really don’t know what the future me would want lol. I assumed that I have all the knowledge, but more often than not, with new things experienced, the direction I head to changes.</p><p>Sure a more fit body would be the end goal, but when attribute the reason to a more vibrant start to my morning, did realize it helped me continue on the trend. Something Nicole has said</p><blockquote><p>Yesterday is history. Tomorrow is a mystery. And today? Today is a gift.

Were surprised how we were able to keep in contact, despite different college, major, friend group and extracurricular.</p><p>Back in 2021 made a spreadsheet of everyone I know, name, last time of contact, and topics chatted. Been a year since and thought, perhaps consistency really is the key to keep connections. Steve I reach out every 3 month of so, we simply continue on the topics we last left off, and thus the relationship was kept.</p><p>Do similar things to myself, where everyday I’d pick a photo and place it in an album. Would look back at each one at the end of the year, revisit the highlights of each day.</p><img src="../images/oj-2022-05/childhood-pic.jpg" alt="" style=""><p>This was 12-29-2019 on my album, went back to the old house in China and found this, back in Kindergarten, eager to show my mom how far I can throw fruits at a bridge.</p><p>All of these thoughts came from one question, was been asked why I do these in the first place, keeping track of people, recording lives including my own.</p><p>I felt that, highlights of my life has often being moments unrecorded, I simply didn’t realize how precise these moments would be, at that specific time. I wish to keep a consistent track on how my life has being, thus easier to see such trend, and the same with people I surround myself with, similar thoughts in <a href="https://yizeshen7.github.io/blog/20220513/#Synchronous-Response-Sharing-Pictures">Synchronous Response, Sharing Pictures</a>.</p><h3 id="Saying-Goodbye-Ongoing-Journey"><a href="#Saying-Goodbye-Ongoing-Journey" class="headerlink" title="Saying Goodbye, Ongoing Journey"></a>Saying Goodbye, Ongoing Journey</h3><blockquote><p>I just think that something can be good, and also end, and that thing was still good. And it’s okay to be sad that it ended, too. But the idea that anything that ends is automatically less than this hypothetical eternal state of success… I don’t think that’s doing us any good at all.</p></blockquote><p>Via <a href="https://twitter.com/AngieMcKeown/status/1517219883855003648/photo/1">This twitter post</a>.</p><p>Going further on the people spreadsheet, updated the sheet after the semester ended, and realized half of the sheet was now under the ‘inactive’ section, people I no longer contact.</p><p>Logically it was pretty easy to convince myself, I only have so much time and energy in a given day, and wish to prioritize people I wish to be close with.</p><p>However, whenever I move names to the inactive session, do felt a sense of sorrow, mixed in with regret. Felt I have failed to maintain a relationship, failed to establish consistency given time. If I would have done everything correct, would assume the relationship would last, not forever, but a very long time.</p><p>Thus felt grateful after seeing this tweet lol, thinking of life as phases instead of continues, that I don’t have to cling on to everything forever. For people we used to know, perhaps we are still friends, just lighter; we have grown apart, but that doesn’t take away the mark they left on who I am. Thinking now, ‘knowing them’ in a given time is already precise enough, wish them all the best on their ongoing journey.</p>]]></content>

Sophie mentioned friends ‘not just care about each other, but also keep each other in the loop’.</p><p>Had questions while attempting it, like, how does one remember to take pictures? Asked that to mom and she said</p><blockquote><p>It’s less about remembering, it’s about having others in mind, people you wish to share you know</p></blockquote><p>…and that was the ‘ah ha’ moment lol, reminded of a tip read about writing better blogs</p><blockquote><p>Pick one obsessive person to write for, and let them be a proxy for the kind of reader you want to attract.</p></blockquote><p>Via <a href="https://perell.com/note/write-for-yourself/">Write for One Person</a>.

Overall the conversation was quite chaotic, mixed feelings with me and parents, though do think it was quite valuable.</p><p>For me, was able to label different emotions going through myself during the conversation. Allowing myself to spectate and not fully immersed, I felt more mature perhaps.</p><p>With my parents, realized that it’s less about them intentionally ignoring my needs, they simply don’t know a different way, as mom and dad had flaws in their family growing up.</p><p>It felt ironic because, both me and my parents were holding shields as we don’t understand each other, and it was only until we put it down, that we were truly able to do so.</p><h3 id="Term-Projects-Knowing-When’s-Enough"><a href="#Term-Projects-Knowing-When’s-Enough" class="headerlink" title="Term Projects, Knowing When’s Enough"></a>Term Projects, Knowing When’s Enough</h3><img src="../images/oj-2022-04/tp-mentee-projects.png" alt="I am so proud of you all :')"><span class="image-caption">I am so proud of you all :')</span><p>More of an observation, my mentees’ ability to stop and be content with what they have.</p><p>During Term Project season for the course we TA in, I asked every mentee of mine what grades they wish to get. With some calculations many of them said with pleasant surprise</p><blockquote><p>Dude I only need a 80 to keep my current grade (okay not all said dude most were pretty respectful)</p></blockquote><p>And that’s exactly what they did lol. Mind you that most features they did post MVP merely got them any algorithmic points. I was worried, but then my garding partner, first thing after seen live demos from my mentees</p><blockquote><p>Damn your mentees all look so happy</p></blockquote><p>And I was like, yeah that’s true, grades was never their priority.</p><p>My mentees were the perfect example of <a href="https://mindingourway.com/half-assing-it-with-everything-youve-got/">Half-assing it with everything you’ve got</a>, they know how to reach their desired goal with no wasted motion.</p><p>And for me, grades was the single metric that I valued, when there are other factors that’s not on the grading rubric, things like happiness and passion. They reached their grade goal, felt satisfied with what they had, and prioritized on other metrics they have on the project.</p><p>In my final thank you email I wrote</p><blockquote><p>Thanks for hand holding me through wordle basics, showing me the possibility of getting an electric skateboard, reaching out to me on completely none 112 updates, citing tuna salad recipes, and teaching me to feel content with what we have, instead of what could have being :D.</p></blockquote><p>Happiness is the difference between what you have, and your definition of enough. Thought I was supposed to be the one that guided their path, turns out I was the one that learned the most from these lovely people lol.</p><h3 id="Failed-Confession"><a href="#Failed-Confession" class="headerlink" title="Failed Confession"></a>Failed Confession</h3><img src="../images/oj-2022-04/failed-confession.jpg" alt="placeholder" style="width:70%; height:70%;"><span class="image-caption">placeholder</span><p>Realized there aren’t much more to share, I have mentioned most things I learned above.</p><p>Family chat, synchronous response, and TP season were more on what I did, failed confessions felt like the reason why I did them. Through the failed confession I learned the power of direct communication, this wish to have others on my mind, and overall, be satisfied with how the relationship has evolved.</p><p>Questions still lingers in my head though, I am confused on how to approach this new relationship, unsure about my next step. Asked Thomas and he said</p><blockquote><p>There isn’t a canonical answer for a question this diverse, …willing to discover and experience how complex life is together, that’s my definition of an intimate relationship</p></blockquote><p>Be willing to commit, express and grow with my counterpart, perhaps that’s what I wish to work on next.</p>]]></content>

Walked downstairs, fire trucks came, after around half an hour we got informed it was a false alarm.</p><p>Less about the event, when heard the siren was originally sound asleep, felt, quite vunlerable and this fear of being dead slided in, remember heart rate went up, arm and leg stiffened, mind going blank and all stimulates rushing in, unable to process them one by one.</p><p>As it turnes out, someone left a towel at the sauna coal space, the towel caught on fire and the alarm went off for the whole building lol.</p><h3 id="Let-Myself-be-Human-It’s-Okay-to-Feel-Down"><a href="#Let-Myself-be-Human-It’s-Okay-to-Feel-Down" class="headerlink" title="Let Myself be Human, It’s Okay to Feel Down"></a>Let Myself be Human, It’s Okay to Feel Down</h3><p>Tends to get swamped by work at around week 6 to 7 during a semester, with midterms pileing up, extracurricular ramping up in speed.</p><p>This semester specifically, felt less motivated then usual, had a hard time keeping a jounral, not to mention waking up at 6am every morning.</p><p>Though read this article</p><blockquote><p>似乎自己从睁眼开始一天都精力充沛才是健康的。可能也是一种社会规训的结果，永远进步，永远螺旋向上。但其实这不是人类真实的状态啊。人是会累的，人是有情绪的，我们是可以低落的。允许自己有这样的情绪，并且不过度解读，或许是保持平衡的方法。</p></blockquote><p>Via <a href="https://sirius.zhubai.love/posts/2101877868530454528" target="_blank">吾栖之地 - 是可以低落的</a>. Thought that, instead of not feeling down, perhaps it’s better to find activities to help get out of this state?</p><p>And on another article</p><blockquote><p>… 情绪可以带着我们走，那我们能不能带着情绪走？</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>有人会健身 2 小时，有人会睡觉，有人会读书，有人会看综艺节目，有人会发呆。我会背 85 个单词。大家都有某种办法，来应对情绪不好的时刻。</p></blockquote><p>Via <a href="https://elizen.zhubai.love/posts/2108083783668178944" target="_blank">叁拾一周</a>. Have started baking a bit more as spring break approaches, wish to explore more.</p><h3 id="Grandpa-天天乐-and-Staying-Happy"><a href="#Grandpa-天天乐-and-Staying-Happy" class="headerlink" title="Grandpa, 天天乐, and Staying Happy"></a>Grandpa, 天天乐, and Staying Happy</h3><img src="../images/oj-2022-02/calligraphy.jpeg" alt="" style="width:70%; height:70%;"><p>Grandpa changed his pen name to 天天乐, found out two weeks ago during our video chat.</p><p>As he turned 80 last year, grandpa’s vision of life solidified even more, as he attempts to teach me every single we call:</p><blockquote><p>身体第一，学业第二，有空多去交交朋友。</p></blockquote><p>There nothing more important than ‘stay healthy and be happy’ as he state, linking to his new pen name, which translate quite literally to ‘happy everyday’.</p><p>Although I laughed at the new name, do agree. For both me and grandpa, a well being enable us to explore so much more, and being happy brings a positive impact to people we surround ourselves with.</p><p>On how to achieve that state, here is another list that grandpa ask everytime we chat:</p><blockquote><p>Have you had dinner yet<br>Has anyone being bullying you at school<br>Come back and pay a visit ;-;</p></blockquote><p>Answers for these have being consistent ever since start of the pandemic, but this doesn’t stop grandpa from asking. He would nod his head in approval when hearing the first answer, give a good smile hearing the second, and twist his face in disappointment coming to third.</p><p>Saw an article on the benefits of living past 30, as the seemingly infinite path ahead slowly converges</p><blockquote><p>年过三十的好处是，再也不用对未来权衡利弊了。终于开始可以不计得失地面对想走的那条路。哪怕道路幽深，野草荒芜，看不清前路。</p></blockquote><p>Via <a href="http://lillianwho.com/post/30+%E7%9A%84%E5%A5%BD%E5%A4%84/" target="_blank">喜于微 - 30+的好处</a>.

Felt that, when people reach for help, they aren’t always looking to resolve the issue from talking to me.</p><p>Rather of understanding emotions, I tend to take actions. When one say their throat hurts I went to CVS and got them cough drops the next day, and when one say they feel stressed as they have no time for lunch I get them meal replacement.</p><p>Relized this pragmatic approach I learned directly from my parents, I’ve never thought there would be a, different approach.</p><p>Back in 2020 there was a time I did bad on one exam, drag myself downstairs and told my mom about it. Washing dishes at the time, recall mom slammed the pot that at the sink, water splashing out, asked not to talk on these kinds of things anymore, she seemed, quite frustrated and vulenerable.</p><p>Mother saw my ask for empathy as compassion, there was little she can help with regarding an exam on web development. On the same end, me, took this directly as the way I can help others.</p><blockquote><p>His experience may have impacted his views, When people talk to you, they are not talking about their views, but their pains.</p></blockquote><p>Via <a href="https://via.zhubai.love/posts/2101188043968040960" target="_blank">事不过三 - 阅读碎片</a>.</p><h2 id="Reading-List"><a href="#Reading-List" class="headerlink" title="Reading List"></a>Reading List</h2><ul><li><a href="https://zhuanlan.zhihu.com/p/19698994">如何活着：欲望、外界、标签、天才、时间、人生目标和经历</a></li></ul>]]></content>

Though knowing that we are in a store, why the hurry?</p><p>Felt I tend to set my eye too focused on the result, and forgot about the journey on how I get there.</p><p>It took more time yes, though with the time we spent at the shop, we got time to chat topics that doesn’t exist in dorm rooms, share the joy finding unexpected things.</p><p>As for last week it was Trader Joe’s ‘Asian Dipping Sause’, turned out to it was just vinegar lol.</p><h3 id="How-to-Not-Die-Alone-A-More-Intentional-Life"><a href="#How-to-Not-Die-Alone-A-More-Intentional-Life" class="headerlink" title="How to Not Die Alone, A More Intentional Life"></a>How to Not Die Alone, A More Intentional Life</h3><p>Spent sometime during winter break, finsihed the book on the flight getting back to campus.</p><p>‘Making life more intentional’ was the part I resonate the most, not just being more proactive on finding a relationship, but making you and the counterpart on the same page, choosing an relationship, instead of sliding into it.</p><p>Now there are more freedom for me to choose, who I get to spent time with, what I wish to do, when I want to do them. Given that, thought I can be more proactive&#x2F;intentional, be more informed when making a choice.</p><p>The book was quite an enjoyable read, most of the lesson I would see myself using 10+ years from now lol.</p><h3 id="Information-System-Adimission-Making-Peace-with-Parents"><a href="#Information-System-Adimission-Making-Peace-with-Parents" class="headerlink" title="Information System Adimission, Making Peace with Parents"></a>Information System Adimission, Making Peace with Parents</h3><p>Told my parents about getting adimitted into Information Systems, news I held back from August 2020.</p><p>Found it diffcult opening up to my parents, they are the types of person who tends to be raw and direct, many instances when talking with them, have this feeling of torn and reluctance, it’s almost like, peeling band aid from a fresh cut?</p><p>Though recently finished <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36072.The_7_Habits_of_Highly_Effective_People" target="_blank">The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People</a>, from the book:</p><blockquote><p>Between stimulus and response there is a space.

During the chat she mentioned what made her chose a start up over bigger industries, her view on work life balance</p><p>Previously thought work life balance can only be achieved when you are successful, and I was no where near to be, especailly after several rounds of interview rejections.</p><p>To the ex-TA, it’s less about how successful one is, more on, what kind of life she wish to be in. Although soon to be a graduate, she still wish to meet like minded people, work at a slower paced enviroment. To her, start up is more like the continuation of school, allowing her to explore her options, before coming into a commitment.</p><p>Reminded of this saying, ‘life path is an oepn field, not a tunnel’, if I’ve been too focused on one path that everyone else is walking on.</p><h2 id="Things-I’ve-Read"><a href="#Things-I’ve-Read" class="headerlink" title="Things I’ve Read"></a>Things I’ve Read</h2><ul><li><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/54304221-how-to-not-die-alone" target="_blank">How to Not Die Along</a></li><li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VZcfPGKwt-I" target="_blank">The Boy, The Mole, The Fox and the Horse</a></li><li><a href="https://perell.com/essay/against-3x-speed/" target="_blank">Against 3X Speed</a></li><li><a href="https://mindingourway.com/half-assing-it-with-everything-youve-got/" target="_blank">Half ass it with everything you’ve got</a></li><li><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/guides/smarterliving/how-to-be-a-better-friend" target="_blank">How to Be a Better Friend</a></li></ul>]]></content>

To be honest, I am still not sure, and would agree how mature these platforms are compare to this, how many more people I may be able to reach.</p><p>Though thinking now, perhaps I chose the flexibility&#x2F;freedom over most things? On this site I get to post anything, images, videos, short&#x2F;long paragraphs, even a google map if I really feel like it. Realizing that I tend to change as time progresses, having a site that can synchronusly adapt to who I am, feel this would be a better fit for the purpose on recording my life in the coming years (if I have that much time that is :’) ).</p><p>Along with that, felt some kind of pressure when attempting to post on WeChat&#x2F;Instagrams, this thought of wanting to make posts I sent well polished. Here I simply do whatever I wish, without thinking about audience of these post, and how they would react towards it. Want this site to be a place to record&#x2F;express myself, and less about interactions that might come after.</p><p>With that being said though, am not against posting things on social medias. I followed a few blog-like acount on WeChat and Medium, and have enjoyed them very much. Knowing that it’s more about on what you send, less on where you sent these, still in this early stage of exploring options, so wouldn’t be surprised if I change my mind later in the future. Nonetheless, formulating my ideas into words, record my life without worries, these are goals I don’t wish to change, no matter which platform I ended up using :).</p>]]></content>

About a week later, I was picked up by his friend Steven, and went on this two day and one night camping trip :D.</p><p>The trip was very nice, we had hot pot on the first night we got there, took a hike half way around the lake, and played Call of Cthulhu before we went to bed.</p><p>Thinking back, I didn’t remember anything specific from the trip, just thought it was a great time talking with them both, and was a relaxing break from everything going on in my gap semester.</p><p>Steve and Steven were no doubt some of the more successful students I met, EECE in UCB, interned at Intel, Amazon, and Apple, great multi-taskers with passions towards almost everything. Nonetheless, found myself enjoying other sides of them, game enthusiasts, anime lovers, and experts in Cthulhu mythos. Interacting with them made me rethink how I should balance between school and life, how I can enjoy my time during school, while learning something new :).</p>]]></content>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Before admitted as a TA, one very kind TA reached out through email, asked if there was anything I wish to know on being a teaching assitant. Back then never had the courage to ask, and before I ever had the chance to do so, I became a teaching assitance myself :’). Realizing that being a TA is a lot more than just teaching recitations, thought I would record some thoughts here.</p><h2 id="Grading"><a href="#Grading" class="headerlink" title="Grading"></a>Grading</h2><img src="../images/2020-12-10/ta-grading.png" alt="A snippet of how the TA OHQ works" style=""><span class="image-caption">A snippet of how the TA OHQ works</span><p>In the course we TAed, all quizes were graded the day students took them, although have fully expected this coming in as a TA, was surprsied how much we interact while grading.</p><p>We would share how a student struggles to write for loops but overcame all obstacles and derived to the right solution, ask about each other’s day, laugh at funny drawings student put on paper, when they finished early or have given up on a problem entirely lol.</p><p>Thought grading quizzes would be time consuming and hectic, which turned out to be true, but on the other hand, working with a group of peoeple towards the same goal, laugh&#x2F;sturggle together along the way, felt that was one thing that made these Tuesday night more attractive than what it could have being.</p><h2 id="Hackathon"><a href="#Hackathon" class="headerlink" title="Hackathon"></a>Hackathon</h2><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ThNc4N_0Bo8" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe><p>We host a hackathon every semester, where students get to create an applicaiton using what they learned, with up to 3 other members, within 24 hours. That semester I was in charge of making a hype video for the event that semester, and yeah, I have never really edit a hype video before :’).</p><p>It took me 13 hours to complete just the first draft, 6 more hours to render the second draft, and 2 more hours to convince the event lead that I used 19 hours to make this 1.5 minute video lol. Looking back, the video I put together was hardly a hype video, nonetheless, putting my skills into use, was surprised how much more confident&#x2F;conpedent I felt, knowing that I can help people around me in more ways than one.</p><h2 id="Term-Project-Mentor"><a href="#Term-Project-Mentor" class="headerlink" title="Term Project Mentor"></a>Term Project Mentor</h2><img src="../images/2020-12-10/term-project-f20.png" alt="Placeholder, please don't sue me if you are in the picture :')" style=""><span class="image-caption">Placeholder, please don't sue me if you are in the picture :')</span><p>I was lucky enough to have great students as my TP mentee to begin with. Every one of my mentee was on time to every meeting, all past MVP by the deadline, respond to my email spam within 2 hours, and all reached out for help when they needed it, which made my job, so, so much easier.</p><p>It was a pleasure working with them, and they also taught me that, when students hit a threshold on coding proficiency, debugging helps were no longer their top priority in TP. Some wished to tackle a problem they are interested in, some wanted a good score to boost their overall grades, and some just tried to have some fun. Understand other’s motivation and help them fulfill that, felt that was something I leraned working with them, even after being a TP mentor.</p><h2 id="Professor-OH"><a href="#Professor-OH" class="headerlink" title="Professor OH"></a>Professor OH</h2><img src="../images/2020-12-10/ohq.png" alt="Placeholder, please don't sue me if you are in the picture :')" style=""><span class="image-caption">Placeholder, please don't sue me if you are in the picture :')</span><p>Not that I didn’t expect students coming to these, but I was shooked how much less office hours was about professors, when we did them online. During that semester specifically, professor would invite student into a breakout room and talk individually, leaving the rest of queue waiting in the main room with the moderator TA.</p><p>Have considered myself a listener more than a storyteller, so it was always a bit awkwards, stuck with a room full with students, looking at each other, trying to find a topic to chat about, AFTER I have asked them how the weather is in Pittsrbugh 27 times :’).</p><p>Nonetheless, felt that was where I observed the most from other students and TAs. Fake birthday letter someone wrote to their penmate, where the professor got their hawaiian shirt (it was from Amazon), what people ate for lunch, conversations&#x2F;stories like these made me reazlied we were much, much more complicated than just TAs&#x2F;students, and it was nice getting to know them beyond the scope of the course :).</p><h2 id="Burnout"><a href="#Burnout" class="headerlink" title="Burnout"></a>Burnout</h2><p>This TA position required about 12-15 hours of commitment weekly, equivlent to a 12 unit course at the university. Burn out was something that I felt that semester, with turbulance in and outside of the course, I was again a bit lost on what I wish to do in the future. Instead of going it through myself though, the support from students&#x2F;TA was, overwhleming to say the very least.</p><p>Some took the time and recognized the time that I put into this job, some gave me advices on how I should approach other’s feedback. I got compared to Master Oogway once (didn’t know what that was and had to search it up lol), listened to others talk about their struggles outside of the course and how they attempted to resolve it.</p><p>Looking back, still not sure how helpful these was, I felt I have done quite a terrible job at understanding these, but if anything, I was happy that I wasn’t alone going through these, and appreciated their company along the way.</p><h2 id="Ending-Thoughts"><a href="#Ending-Thoughts" class="headerlink" title="Ending Thoughts"></a>Ending Thoughts</h2><p>I guess I was conviced, towards the end of the semester, on why being a TA is ‘fun and exciting’, and something people wish to continue doing ‘until they graduate’. It was less about the materials you get to teach your student, and definitely not the pay :&#x2F;. To me it was more about the experience, working with people that I look up to, talkiong with others that I may not otherwise have the chance to meet, and learn about different ways about approacing problems.</p>]]></content>

    <title>Teaching Assistant and Recitation</title>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Nervous and anxious on this new role, in the two recitation sections that I got assigned to, felt I was taught more by my partner TAs and students, than I have taught them computer science.</p><h2 id="Silence"><a href="#Silence" class="headerlink" title="Silence"></a>Silence</h2><p>I wished to minimize silence in any social interactions, felt the existence of it came from me not asking the right question, or my counterparts being confused on what I said. The mere presence of silence was, akward to me at the time, and that’s exactly what occured in the majority of the recitation when I got up and teach :’). Even when recitations that semester being entirely on zoom, whenever no one answers my call, I can almost touch the akward silence floating in my bedroom.</p><p>Funny enough though, my teaching partner in the eailer recitation was never afraid of that. Instead of panicking (like me), she would intentionally pauses for a moment whenever she finishes a sentence.</p><p>Counterintuitive at the time, but it did make sense. Compare to us, who have learned the material in advance, with the solution right in front of us, students in recitations have little idea on what’s going on, and would oftentime need some moment to process everything we said &amp; asked. By keeping some instances of silence, she allowed students to breath, reflect on the material, recall for the process of problem solving, and also for her to process what she wants to say next :).</p><h2 id="Voice-Fluctuation"><a href="#Voice-Fluctuation" class="headerlink" title="Voice Fluctuation"></a>Voice Fluctuation</h2><p>Rather than observing this from my recitation partner in the latter section, voice fluctuation was something she wished to learn, something her sister is appreantly great at.</p><p>In her words, the way we present material are just as important as the material itself, and by shifting our tone of voice, we highlight things that’s important and deprioritize things that’s not, helping students to understand better, without actively interpreting what we say B).</p><p>As I attempted to learn this alongside with her, different ways of direct student’s attention, was something broader about presentation that I witnessed while she teaches. Things like present visulizations with contrasting colors, align pseudo code with actual solutions, bring up questions that student might have without them asking for it. Felt she understood her student and viewed problems from their perspective, which helps her to allocate time&#x2F;attention on more confusing topics, gave students some idea on what’s important&#x2F;will be seen throughout the future, and what’s not.</p><p>On a side note, as much as she tried to fluctuate her voice that semester, she always sounds excited during recitation, not sure if these students ever figured out what was going on….</p><h2 id="Say-‘I-Don’t-Know’"><a href="#Say-‘I-Don’t-Know’" class="headerlink" title="Say ‘I Don’t Know’"></a>Say ‘I Don’t Know’</h2><p>With a weaker grasp on the course material compare to other TAs, even when I left space for silence and bettered my presentation, I often would be just as confused, when student asks follow up questions regarding solutions, or clearfication on course concepts.</p><p>With all the options that I had, admitting incapability were usually my last resort. The moment that I say such phrase, I felt, weak and incompetent as a TA. TAs that I look up to always seem to know what to say, regardless of scenarios in front of them, and everytime that I say ‘I don’t know’, the gap between me and these people just seems to get, wider and larger.</p><p>And that’s where I was taught by my recitation students. Only towards the end of the semester that I realized, most student I met doesn’t mind when I say ‘I don’t know’, they care more about what I say after that. Whether it is to look it up on the web, let my partner TA in recitation chime in, or to do some research and get back to them through email. Understanding that my job is to provide the best possible answer, and I have more than one way of doing so, it did make me feel less intimidated, whenever a student rises their hand in the end of every problem.</p><h2 id="Ending-Thoughts"><a href="#Ending-Thoughts" class="headerlink" title="Ending Thoughts"></a>Ending Thoughts</h2><p>Rather than saying I learned, these were things that I observed, things that I want to work on in the future. I wish one day I can leave myself some time to think evertime before I speak, convey my emotion and thoughts by rising and lowering my voice, and be more honest with others, including myself.</p><p>Going back to these recitations itself though, knowing that my path would unlikly cross again with these people, I guess it’s now safe for me to say, it was nothing but joy working with them this semester, they were some of the best people I’ve met, and I wish them the best in coming chapters of their jounrey :).</p>]]></content>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ThNc4N_0Bo8" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe><p>Multiple time have I thought to write about this, though I never felt I can talk much about this project, despite being the author.</p><p>The idea of 15-112 Simulator came directly from my TP mentor, most of the feature in game are credited to TAs&#x2F;professors that I talked to, the project itself was below average on both complexity and effective lines of code, not to mention the code structure, I only realized I can create a reuseable button class after I finsihed the project lol.</p><p>Regardless, that four weeks of TP did teach me things outside of computer science and coding, and these are what I wish to draw down here.</p><h2 id="Ask-For-Help"><a href="#Ask-For-Help" class="headerlink" title="Ask For Help"></a>Ask For Help</h2><p>Back in highschool I was pretty reluctant to reach out in most situations, felt like I can handle everything on my own. During TP it was eh, a completely different story. There were times where it took me hours to figure a feature out, only to realize later that it broke other parts of my project :’).</p><p>It was, quite a stressful time, but even then I didn’t really think about asking for help, as I thought my code has became so complex that only a few could comprehend. And as expected, every TA that I met during office hour were quite confused on what I wrote, but it wasn’t a waste of time, to my surprise.</p><p>Some TAs left advices on coding best practices (which I only started following after the term project), some gave me alternatives features that’s more doable, and there was one TA, who sat with me for over an hour, half naked on Zoom, just to figure out how I can run my game without crashing the canvas three seconds later. Nathan, if you ever happens to read this, thank you.</p><p>Being completely honest, even after going through office hours, most of the bug I encountered ended up still not getting resovled, and oftentimes I had to figure ways around them. I rarely got what I asked for when I reachout for help, but the passion shown by these TAs, along with a sense of responsibility they posses, was something that left impressions on me in coming semesters.</p><h2 id="Listen-and-Understand"><a href="#Listen-and-Understand" class="headerlink" title="Listen and Understand"></a>Listen and Understand</h2><p>One sad things about making a game on a course is that, you only have a limited view on what it is like; and if you want to get a more objective view of it, you have to ask for other’s input.</p><p>And this was probably the single thing that I appreciate the most, being forced to ask for opnions and feedbacks, consantly. I learned to pick up words that my counterpart is using, rephrase what they are trying to convey, and ask for clearfications whenever I don’t understand.</p><p>Besides gaining experience on reaching out, was surprised how many idas I got just by talking with others. Almost every feature in the game were taken inspiration from one of the professor&#x2F;TA&#x2F;student who are involved in the course at the time. Compare to doing things solely by myself, things does get a lot eaiser when you have other people by your side helping you out.</p><p>This was also the time where I realized that, yeah everyone in CMU is smarter than me, as much as I don’t want to admit :’).</p><h2 id="Reflecting-on-College"><a href="#Reflecting-on-College" class="headerlink" title="Reflecting on College"></a>Reflecting on College</h2><p>Back in highschool I was pretty excited about college, thought it would be a time to learn something new, and a place to change myself a little. TP season happens to be the time where a global pandemic hits, so I ended up moving back to California to live with my family.</p><p>Sitting in my old bedroom, realized that, after a semester of college, I am still very much the same person lol. And knowing that nothing really changed despite my best effort, I sort of lost motivation for most things that semester, this project included, as I wasn’t so sure about what I want to do in coming semesters.</p><p>It was a bit hard to get myself to write code during that week of TP, remember laying on bed, wishing everything to be over soon, only to wake up the next morning, found out nothing has really changed, and there are now more works left for me to do.</p><p>Not the best time I had in college, but this was also the time where I get to think back on my college experience, adjust my expectaions, and reflect them directly on my project in the end. Going back to reaching out and listening to others, turns out I wasn’t the only person who felt that way in a global pandemic, and surprisingly, not the only one who struggled to complete things. Thanks to everyone that I met during that period of time, was able to collect myself together, and finished this project at the last possible minute.</p><h2 id="Ending-Thoughts"><a href="#Ending-Thoughts" class="headerlink" title="Ending Thoughts"></a>Ending Thoughts</h2><p>I got more out of this project than I have contributed to it, and felt quite grateful on what I’ve experienced, along with everything I’ve learned. I am still passive, uncurious, blunt, and still have a hard time understanding people around me, but realizing that there are more than one way I can resolve this, and I don’t have to do this along, this was probably the best lesson I got in 2020 :D.</p>]]></content>
    
    
    <summary type="html">Knowing little about coding coming into the University, I didn&#39;t expect myself to have this fun creating something I had in mind.

Stunned by how modern my city has became, I was more drawn to the people I got to meet, as it has being just about 3 years since we last chatted.</p><h2 id="Lolo-and-Ina"><a href="#Lolo-and-Ina" class="headerlink" title="Lolo and Ina"></a>Lolo and Ina</h2><p>If you can’t see it from the picture above, I really like Lolo and Ina :D. Three years no see, we still had a good time chatting at the dinner, hearing things happening in the new school Lolo went to, plus all the fun things happened at Ina’s kindergarden.</p><p>5 years apart from Lolo and 12 years apart from Ina, It’s quite nice to see how similar we still are. We all played piano when we were kids, enjoyed watching cartoons, and likes to order 东坡肉 when we are at a resterant.</p><h2 id="Kimi"><a href="#Kimi" class="headerlink" title="Kimi"></a>Kimi</h2><p>Kimi was one of the only non-relatives that we visited during our stay. We lived in the same neighborhood back in China, played together for a few times, and have known each other ever since.</p><p>If I was surprised when I met Lolo and Ina, I was shocked when I met Kimi lol. Recently with COVID, has being video chatting with Kimi every now and then. Independent, active, and competitive, she is now studying at a high school in the UK, playing lacross and compete for her high school team, started learning German, taught herself both C and Python, and have coded programs that would take me hours to code myself :’). Kimi wants to major in Math and Computer science when she is in college, and want to be a reseracher&#x2F;mathmatian once she graduate.</p><p>Kimi’s passion towards winning, her sense of presistance across whatever she is intreted in, has always being something that I looked up to. She is probably prepping for her college aplication as I am writing this, wish her best of luck out there :D.</p><h2 id="Grandpa"><a href="#Grandpa" class="headerlink" title="Grandpa"></a>Grandpa</h2><p>When I felt everything has changed, my grandpa stayed, eh, exactly the same lol. Still the same hobby, same stories that he tells, same color of jacket when going outside, and the same facial expression when we finally needed to leave.</p><p>Being in the army for most of his life, my grandpa kept his rountine 20 years after he retired. He would often wake up at around 5:30 in the morning, take a hour long walk around the West Lake, buy some breakfast at the stand he always goes to, walk back to the house, sit in the living room, watch 朝闻天下 while eating his breakfast at exactly 7.</p><p>Why do I know these, well, waking me up at 5:30 and drag me on his walk happens to be a part of his routine while I was there :’).</p><p>Aside from this rather unpleasent experience though, I did enjoy the stay with my grandpa. We would play chinese chess together and laugh at each other’s play (okay mostly mine) for the whole afternoon, walk to the grocery market to get dinner, and talk about all the changes in the city while I wasn’t here.</p><p>My grandpa refers people at my school as 美国佬, the language we speak as 美国话, and ask me to teach him that one day, so he could come to my place for a visit. He still doesn’t know which school that I went to, but this never gets in the way of him showing how proud he is about me, whether it’s in person, or on video chats yesterday :).</p><h2 id="Ending-thoughts"><a href="#Ending-thoughts" class="headerlink" title="Ending thoughts"></a>Ending thoughts</h2><p>Aside from how fast time flied, realized how people centric I am from this trip. Didn’t feel much when I walked around my elementary school, but memories flushed back after talking with teachers who used to teach me there, the exact same with my relatives, Kimi, and grandpa. It was a great time meeting these people again, happy that we got the chance to go back and visit.</p>]]></content>

Our friends and parents filled the entire stadium hours before the ceremony started, and the local police had to come and help direct the traffic lol.</p><p>The ceremony itself was, quite exciting, it was a place for everyone to celebrate the past, present, and future all at the same time. I didn’t remember most of it to be honest, but was quite happy when the principle handed me the diploma. Using my host family’s word, I am offically an educated man now B).</p><p>Thinking back to my four years at this school, I honestly can’t recall anything significant. I took courses just as every other student in the school would, tried my best to maintain GPA, did swim and water polo for a few semesters, met some friends, and yeah, that’s about it :). I didn’t feel much of a connection to this school or my class, as most of the people I knew have gradued a year in advance.</p><p>At the time I already knew where I would be going next fall for univeristy, and was pretty excited for it. I didn’t pay too close of an attention to the ceremony, in that very moment, my mind has already wondered to college, eager to find out what my next four year is going to be like.</p><p>Uncertainty, relief, along with a bit of excitment? It was an intresting experience overall, felt this ceremony was more like a new begining, compare to an end.</p>]]></content>

Just about a year has past since the trip, thought it would be nice for me to record these thoughts, just in case I have do someting similar in the future.</p><h2 id="Make-a-More-Versatile-Plan"><a href="#Make-a-More-Versatile-Plan" class="headerlink" title="Make a More Versatile Plan"></a>Make a More Versatile Plan</h2><p>The third day that we were in Seattle, we got stucked in the hotel elevator, when we tried to come down and grab some breakfast :’). Luckly noo one died in the end (except the hotel manager lol), but we did lose a few precious hour of that morning, and the plan I got for the day had to be cancelled. In the end, we walked around Pike’s Place and took some pictures, checkout the image above if you want a reference :D.</p><p>What I realized was that, rather than making a plan composed entirely on when to do what, should have instead, make another category of things we can do at any given moment. Walk around Pike’s Place, visit the Central Public Library, or even just to go and checkout the Chinatown. These events, although trivial, would make a trip more fluid and flexible, helps me better adjust to the current situation of the trip.</p><h2 id="Have-Half-of-Day-of-Nothing"><a href="#Have-Half-of-Day-of-Nothing" class="headerlink" title="Have Half of Day of Nothing"></a>Have Half of Day of Nothing</h2><p>So I did have that on my original plan, but mainly because I ran out of things to do lol.</p><p>It was an afternoon towards the end of the trip, me and my mom ended up sitting in the hotel room, and chatted about the trip as a whole, things that we individually saw, funny pictures we took, and reflections we had.</p><p>To my surprise, that afternoon became one of the highlights through the trip. I did enjoy walking around the city and visiting new places, but really appreciate that short afternoon of doing nothing, reflecting things that we did, and exchange thoughts on how we can improve.</p><p>Might be because who I was with, my mom, who is much wiser and more mature than me. However, when places we visit would eventually get forgotten, soviourers we bought would at one day be thrown away, I still remember reflections my mom had, along with things that she said. This half day of nothing may be different for everyone, a time to organize pictures they took, a moment to catch up on sleep, but for me, thought it was a great oppotunity, getting feedback from the trip, and take notes on how I can do better on the next.</p><h2 id="Enjoy-the-Trip"><a href="#Enjoy-the-Trip" class="headerlink" title="Enjoy the Trip"></a>Enjoy the Trip</h2><p>Really didn’t think about this until much later after the trip, but with more trips I took throughout the year, looking back, I didn’t quite ‘enjoy’ this trip compare to the other. I was solely looking for popular places around Seattle, and blindly adding them to the trip plan.</p><p>My mom enjoys taking pictures, so Chinatown or a longer visit at Chihuly Garden of Glass, would probably have being a better option for her. I perfer going somewhere quiet and just sit there, so should have marked a longer day trip at Mount Rainier, or even make a stop at the public library.</p><p>Now all that being said, it took me a while to figure out what I enjoyed on a trip. Nonetheless, do felt like I could have done a better job, at least at communciating with my parents while making the travel plan, asking them what their preference was, and make a trip that they would have enjoyed more.</p><h2 id="Ending-Thoughts"><a href="#Ending-Thoughts" class="headerlink" title="Ending Thoughts"></a>Ending Thoughts</h2><p>Truth be told, I still didn’t know where Seattle is at, even after we finished the trip lol. But it was, all in all, a great time visiting there :D.</p>]]></content>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Thinking back to my stay, these three puppies were almost always the first thing that cames to my mind. Being someone who never really had a pet, dealing with three was, quite an unique experience.</p><h2 id="Wofie"><a href="#Wofie" class="headerlink" title="Wofie"></a>Wofie</h2><img src="../images/2018-03-18/wofie.jpeg" alt="Wofie, not very happy that the shutter sound woke him up" style="width:80%; height:80%;"><span class="image-caption">Wofie, not very happy that the shutter sound woke him up</span><p>Wofie is the cloest defnition I have, if you asked me what a dog is like 5 years ago. Active, loyal, attention craving, as a Schnauzer with a giant ego, Wofie is, well, not very pleasent to interact with, to say the very least :’).</p><p>I tend prefer peace and quiet, so the sole existance of Wofie has, bothered me a little. He would be running around the house constantly, marking his territory, asserting his dominance over the other two (and sometimes me), if we ever left him unchecked for more than ten minutes. He would come over and yell at us if we are having too much fun without him at the dinner, and brak for hours, just to chase the bird outside away, who is merely trying to built a nest.</p><p>As unpleasent as he was to deal with, as the most straightforward one out of all three, Wofie was the first that I was able to understood. If he barks he wants to go outside, if he growls someone is in his way, and if he does anything else, well, he is probably looking for a treat…</p><p>Thinking back, Wofie might just have being the most brilliant human trainer I have met. He is honest, straightforward, doesn’t hide away his feelings and never overthinks, which helped us greatly to gave him what he wanted.</p><h2 id="Lizzy"><a href="#Lizzy" class="headerlink" title="Lizzy"></a>Lizzy</h2><img src="../images/2018-03-18/lizzy.jpeg" alt="Lizzy, sleeping on the bed where I sleep :')" style="width:50%; height:50%;"><span class="image-caption">Lizzy, sleeping on the bed where I sleep :')</span><p>A Dachshund and Schnauzer mix, Lizzy remained as my host family’s favorite through my time there. She is ‘Liz’ for host mom, and ‘my baby girl’ for host dad. She enjoys the first 10 minutes of every walk, likes to sleep on the sofa whenever someoen is there, and loves to destory toys, whenever we buy her something squeaky :’).</p><p>Aside from her charisma, Lizzy has a sense of curiocity that can only be found from a puppy. She would come and sniff every package delivered at the front porch, and meeting new people with some lick on the face. In the summer of 2017, that curiocity got her bitten by a rattle snake, along with three nights of stay in the pet hospital. After that the urge of getting to know everything has rapidly cooled down, though still, whenever she would hear someone standing at the door, she would still rush to the door, stand up with her tails swingglings from side to side, just to see who is there.</p><h2 id="Ares"><a href="#Ares" class="headerlink" title="Ares"></a>Ares</h2><img src="../images/2018-03-18/ares.jpeg" alt="Ares with his innocent look" style="width:80%; height:80%;"><span class="image-caption">Ares with his innocent look</span><p>The host family’s son adopted Ares and named him after the god of war. Contrary to this aggresive name though, as a pit bull, Ares is surprisingly chill and quite, just like me B).</p><p>Sleeping and walking are really the only two activies Ares does. On a typicaly day, he would drag himself to the living room sofa, lay there comfortably until the afternoon, where the host mom (and sometimes I) would take him for a walk. After the walk, he would return to his favorite spot on the sofa, sleep there until the evening, where he would go to my host dad’s room and enjoy the rest of the night there.</p><p>As low energy as Ares sound, he turns into a different dog whenever he is outside. He would drag me forward, dig holes on the ground, bite the leash and growls at me if I am going too slow :’).</p><p>Ares loves anywhere but the house, to the point where he ran away, twice, during the time of my stay. The first time he ran all the way to my high school (which is about 10 minutes by car and 30 minutes by foot), and got carried back by some very kind construction workers across the street. The second time he appeantly he ran to the other side of the hill, it was late at night, all we knew was, he got taken back by a even nicer driver who, eh, almost hit him on the street.</p><p>We now get nervous evertime Ares eyes at the front door lol, though as troublesome as he is, would say Ares has been a great partner whenever I decides to do work at the living room sofa. He never craves for attention, seldomly barks even when there are bird chipping outside, and simply rolls over if he wants some belly scarch, letting me enjoys my afternoon without constantly looking out for him :).</p><h2 id="Ending-Thoughts"><a href="#Ending-Thoughts" class="headerlink" title="Ending Thoughts"></a>Ending Thoughts</h2><p>It would be an exaggeration compare these dogs to people I lived with during my stay, though I do think back to these interactions, more than any students who were there. Always be on my bed when I wanted to take a nap, swallow food on the floor faster than I could pick them back up, play dead and smile at exactly halfway of a walk, still not sure if I ever enjoyed their company. Nonetheless though, being something that has feelings and emotions, they were one of the first creatures that I actively try to understand, and something that still lingers around my memory, even today :).</p>]]></content>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Hello and welcome! Want to use this post to talk a bit more about who I am, along with what I wish to accomplish using this website.</p><h2 id="About-Me"><a href="#About-Me" class="headerlink" title="About Me"></a>About Me</h2><p>Really wasn’t joking when I say I am not great with self intros, but anyway lol.</p><p>My name is Yize Shen, currently a university student. As for personality, got ISFJ for Myers Briggs, and a type 6 for Enneagram.</p><p>My favorite color is grey, favorite ice cream flavor is vanilla, enjoy listening to lofi hip hop musics, play both Minecraft and Terraria, currently ranked Iron II in League of Legend, and love cats and dogs equally :].</p><p>Aside from school, usually enjoy spending time by myself. Reading, playing video games, translating, writing jounrals, etc. Though recently did start exploring things I don’t typically do, took a few lessons at a dance studio, learned a bit about acapella, watched a few series on Netflix, attempted to draw using Figma, and applied to be a volunteer at Beijing 2022 Winter Olympic. They were, surprisingly fun I would say? Do think I also appreciate making connections with people other than myself, doing things together in a group.</p><h2 id="About-This-Website"><a href="#About-This-Website" class="headerlink" title="About This Website"></a>About This Website</h2><p>As mentioned in <a target="_self" href="https://yizeshen7.github.io/about/">About</a>, was planning on using this site as a place to record my life and occasionally, thoughts and feelings.</p><p>Like any elder man you see walking on the street, I also tend to forget about things easily :’). To combat servere memory loses, started jounraling back in 2019, just to have a place to put down things I wish to remember. Overtime, felt jounraling has helped me relive my state of mind whenever I look back, so wish this website to be the same.</p><p>Aside from recording my life, want to use this website as a tool to improve my communciation skills. Compare to most people I met who are my age, often felt not as efficiente, formulating thoughts and expressing them in a concise way. Don’t think writing posts on a website would directly help me with that, but hey, for an introvert, this is a giant leap I am taking buddy :’).</p><p>Lastly, if anything, want to use this site for others who wish to know a bit about me. Consider myself pretty straightforward and simple minded, but also realized that, too often I would keep opinons&#x2F;thoughts&#x2F;ideas to myself, rather than expressing them to my counterparts. I don’t wish to be a mystery to most people, and especially people who I surround myself with. This website is intended to be a passive way for me to share a bit about who I am and what I’ve experienced, just incase you are curious :].</p><p>All in all, plan to use this website to record my life, practice my writing skills, and let others to know a bit more about me. Curious to see how this would go, and yeah, thanks for reading.</p><p>On a side note, if you are reading this and have a way to contact me, feel free to reach out! Would love to hear thoughts and feedbacks, if you have any :D.</p>]]></content>
